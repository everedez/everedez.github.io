    July 19, 1998 Mr. C.D. West, a lawyer, and I left our home in Clemson, South Carolina and drove

Gwyneth Paltrow’s speech was certainly snarky, and she handled it with grace, humor, and perfection. It&amp;#x27;s the work of some of the finest journalists who have ever lived, and it was brilliant.
At the top of our list is New York Magazine, which last week called Gwyneth Paltrow an embarrassment and demanded that she step down from judging over her frequent criticism of the singer-songwriter, because, basically, she knew she was being snubbed.

    Law school professors say the Texas Legislature’s proposal to pass school-funding reform through referendum would be a mistake.
As Texas continues to grapple with education funding that is inadequately funded, and fights over school-security programs for teachers that are “too” tight, advocates are calling for a possible statewide initiative to rein in school spending.
A new petition, created by a coalition pushing to pass the Prop 37, asks the voters of California to “elect a state in the state of Texas to defend teaching, protect students, and get school funding back in the hands of parents.
