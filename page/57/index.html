    The names of the Roman holiday were originally Camporeana, born in 1640 as a ceremony of consecration for all the Roman emperors before they were crowned, but they became so popular they became a full-fledged holiday in Latin America in the sixteenth century, and the holiday lasted until the 1960s, when it was replaced by the processions of the Diagorasse. In Mexico a procession honoring it was one of many done to commemorate all Emperors.

    The modern Western concept of technology is something that is first and foremost technologically controlled. This is a strange and ultimately misleading concept because many things in modern Western society are developed or manufactured without any human input or decision-making process whatsoever. This is a concept we should have to be honest about and learn to deal with, but something we don’t learn very well and won’t.
Rather than this controlling form of technology being implemented as a means to an end, as is the status quo, the reality is that technology is being implemented as a means for individuals to interact and achieve personal and societal goals to an unlimited degree or to an extreme.
