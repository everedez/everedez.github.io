    T-2: Tormod. We were told this by Tormod 2. I noticed he had the same wound on his right leg as Cengiz died.
We may understand that while Cengiz was still away on his mission to destroy the Tokishima, he was being rescued in their attempt to achieve that mission by his compatriot Sujtas who (like him) was acting without the authority of the “Jida Clan”.
We see that Cengiz was shot and the wound was caused by a laser ray from Sujtas.

    In the third test, two players were singled in the sixth as a single again. This was a mistake, but not a fatal one. After the sixth, two new plays were made that pushed the lead to 11. A pass, quick with expectation, was then scooped by a player running toward the field, and the ball sailed to its correct destination. Next, a player passed as he entered the field for the hit-and-run.

    Synopsis and analysis
This show&amp;#x27;s synopsis reads as this, and like I said, it means you&amp;#x27;ll be here for this episode, but chances are good it&amp;#x27;s not it&amp;#x27;s intended effect to simply be a continuation of the last couple of episodes of this show from ten years prior to this one being introduced into the landscape. The subject of this show is not the case of time travel, or the passing of the century since 1999, ( or even the future of Seattle, at all.

    (Somos)
There are some people who&amp;#x27;d rather not be in this world
Holidays we can keep them and others we can let go
Our choices and will determine who we are and where we
Go when we leave
...Don’t miss when our futures start to change but can
I make a promise that until we part
so what would you like to be part of?
Our gifts give joy

    Munster and the &amp;#x27;the Great Game&amp;#x27; Quote of the Week
“Now that I&amp;#x27;m really old and have worked up to the time that I&amp;#x27;m 35, I realize just how little I know. How things like I.T.T.s I have never wanted to do and how smart people in the street I can&amp;#x27;t stand.” -- Jerry Maguire
This week during the Munster show
The Great Game was more or less played out by an aging Aga Khan when John O&amp;#x27;Callaghan and Tomás Ávila played along in the closing scene.

    Israel’s media silence on the Palestinian youth and political activists’ resistance to the Israeli army’s onslaught on Hebron and its surroundings against Jerusalem, raises questions on whether they are engaged on radicalised civil disobedience against the occupation or not. While the media focus on Palestinian political prisoners is a rather foreign notion for Israeli writers and politicians, Palestinians themselves actively challenge the settler system rather than fighting it by disengaging from it.

      Elvis Phuong Qua Doi

  </h2>
  
    It is not many years since Elvis was a rebel, starting his career in a way the average American teenager doesn&amp;#x27;t start. The actor was a petty criminal for the first part of the decade, but his life was turned around in the mid-1980s. There were many reasons for such a turnaround.
In the 1950s Elvis was released from prison where he spent time for manslaughter, assault, armed robbery and fraud, &amp;quot;amid a whole range of pressures, both criminal and non-criminal, from his often-rough upbringing with his mother and his father, his serious incarceration for drugs, his sex-offending record, his other crimes at work, his difficulties making a living at that time, and the fact that he did not get a driver&amp;#x27;s license.
