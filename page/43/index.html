    Biography José Carlos Solti y Francisco Solti are brothers, born on July 14, 1979 in Medellín, Colombia, their names are both Spanish, unlike them. The family has a rich folklore connected with the song and party culture of Colombia, as José Carlos Solti was the brainschild behind the most famous dance craze in Colombia, Fuego, and most likely at least somewhat responsible for music career of Solandrena. José Carlos and Francisco are both famous for their dancing and modeling, in Colombia they ran a company with Parnell Buendía and were hired for commercials and events like this one, Fuego Dancing.

    A while back I mentioned in this thread that we were thinking about an early Guilty Gear Strive Stride.

As we talked over the weekend about it (among other things), it never went through for whatever reason. A pretty open explanation would be that we were always wanting to “maximize” the console’s overall resolution.
