Whether it was part of the border wall, or was ignored as asylum seekers trudged into the sea of blue, it was yet another unplanned scene.

    Ever felt like you were the only one dressed up? Can&amp;#x27;t get motivated to quit your desk job just because you actually feel comfortable in your own skin?
