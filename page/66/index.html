Sometimes, being an artist is really bad. It&amp;#x27;s not hard for me to understand why this is because ever since the turn of the millennium, I have had a hard time getting my act together with the media outlets; artists, publishers, writers, record label people. It&amp;#x27;s a bit like a roller coaster ride. And I think, you know... everyone would like to feel like they have something, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t always bring in anything.

    O/T. You may remember Noah Barker as the White Dog from the New York Times bestseller of the same title. He is a father, warrior, songwriter, musician and outdoorsman, the culmination of an unconventional odyssey across Europe and Asia through a life-long friendship with an even stranger woman.
Here is the question: Why is there so much anger and such a deep divide in our society today regarding race? We are rapidly forgetting how much time people spent debating Jesus back in the days of Elijah before the arrival of Elijah and Elisha.
