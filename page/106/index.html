    [Updated] By: Kacey Dunlap | Comments Off Steve Bannon and Chris Christie have been feuding for some time. Mostly, the two camps were criticizing the other for something or other. Now, the feud has gotten violent and could bring one of the biggest political surprises of this year — if only they could agree to actually call the thing off.
[Original post]
On December 18th, John Bolton, a senior adviser to President Trump, told a Wall Street Journal reporter, “His White House is a mess and he won’t get a job from me.

    Only a few days earlier, the news of the death of the former Prime Minster, Abiy Ahmed, was reported by a journalist in his hometown of Tarabani, in Nigeria. The news was immediately picked up by Nigerians, who called Abiy Ahmed an &amp;#x27;Almighty&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;the son of Allah.&amp;#x27; The journalist, on the basis of what he saw, declared that Abiy Ahmed was killed by the Nigerian government. The journalist was one of those who made headlines nationwide in 2002 by denouncing the killing of prominent public officials.

    2. **The Problem** Imagine two people who are conducting some experiments. This person is the first who prepares the DNA sample, which contains a very rare DNA sequence that represents only 11% of the genome. Then it is taken under a microscope, or a set of fluorescent lights, which are then used to spot specific cellular processes. As the person with the DNA of only 11% doesn&amp;#x27;t know what to do with this much DNA, they decide to save the rest of this sequence, which represents 0.

    This year marks the 30th anniversary of the book that started it all.
And another new Toya Boudy book.
I may be a few chapters past the official publication date as I&amp;#x27;ve been away from a keyboard and my Kindle for a few years, but this is one of those books that has stayed with me after all these years. In the middle of the book I often turn to Toya Boudy, who seems to be keeping a great deal of the &amp;quot;golden&amp;quot; work of the early years that are too many to count.
