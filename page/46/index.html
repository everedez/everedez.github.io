    A few years ago, a friend and I went to the University of Missouri to major in philosophy, and then at Missouri S&amp;amp;T, a spinoff university for political science. (Many campuses take up a proclivity for one reason or another when two similar majors are offered that often come from the same kind of research.) In our shared class, we both also took the same liberal arts class, and one of my friends came home excited about something: the job opportunities in journalism were really good.

    Great golfers sometimes make the mistake of thinking that they can hit the greens like a pro. In actuality, this is quite something else, as making golf shots takes a lot of technique and timing. The following golf shot is an example of both.
