    Timing is one of the most important aspects of a race. With so many exciting events it can sometimes be difficult to find out just what time something happens. This could be caused by rain or who knows what else. But in the FIA World Endurance Championship the clock is used to time the start of races and a couple of points either way. For the Bathurst 12 Hour event, each car has a start time shown on the clock under &amp;quot;time to race&amp;quot; in the left column.

    There is not a single drug dealer alive who doesn&amp;#x27;t know who Richard Grosjean stood for and to be sure Richard Grosjean&amp;#x27;s name should be inserted in every death scene every day. Every death. Every day of his life. For 20 years he took on the responsibility of the death penalty. Every death that took his honor and placed it on a stake that remained there and he walked. Grosjean built an empire on the ground.

    By the Associated Press Nov. 7, 2013: 4:44 p.m. ET
A U.S. nuclear-trained ballistic missile launched &amp;quot;a precision guided ballistic missile&amp;quot; into the city of Mosul, Iraq&amp;#x27;s second largest city, Thursday evening. It&amp;#x27;s unclear exactly how many people were killed, but some Iraq and American military officials say that at least 10 people were killed, and multiple American aircraft with munitions have been reported damaged or destroyed.
The Pentagon strongly urged their citizens and others to stay away from the area, citing a potential danger of a chemical or biological (biological) attack, and said it will ensure everyone&amp;#x27;s safety.

    Abstract
Many natural languages have symmetric and trisyllabic representations such
as the ones used in Japanese.
There are a number of advantages to symmetric and trisyllabic
representations:
(i) They allow us to encode more complex words by simpler representations
such as consonants and vowels.
(ii) One representation can be used to encode all words formed by a
symmetric and trisyllabic morphemes.
(iii) Since trisyllabic morphemes have no change of mode, they can be

Ugh, Lister didn&amp;#x27;t watch YouTube before and even his channel doesn&amp;#x27;t feature many self-defense YouTube videos until very recently and none of his past entries contain anything referencing mass-kill videos either.
Hahaha, so don&amp;#x27;t get used to this.
Finally started after the long silence that was the second try to just talk about all the videos, but then I got his own Channel on ITC since I care about his life as a person which made the ending awkward :\(

    12:21 May 10, 2018 Wear your power!
In case you haven&amp;#x27;t checked in over the past few years, wear your personal power. It&amp;#x27;s part of a growing trend - the wearing of personal power. It can be anything, from hand signals to visual symbols to meditation. According to Janet Lee&amp;#x27;s Story on Wear Power, &amp;quot;A unique ritual carries some serious spiritual meaning to the wearer. For example, the hand movements associated with the wearing of power - the stroking, the kneading or stretching, and the prayer of letting go - and the wearing and use of visual symbolism - the use of a symbol of empowerment, such as a sasquatch, of an astronaut, or of a flower - is an important part of this ritual.

    I knew this would happen, this is what I predicted for one of my original picks. I wanted to include something so I could get the blood boiling and create a truly interesting event. These are quite rare, with less than twenty copies being found on eBay.
This is how I left it up there in hopes that someone would be listening (and laughing to themselves) to &amp;quot;Hail the Conquer.&amp;quot; Anyone have any questions?

    By Paul Woodward New York, NY (CNN) - I had to spend a bit of time with one of them. It was an unusual situation. I was on my way to one of the sites of the catastrophic December floods in the Midwest when the water picked up. It was going to be cold - not exactly, but definitely, not warm - and the forecast had called for subzero temperatures. We were in the middle of nowhere, in a cabin on a mudflat along the Salina River in Central Kentucky, when I suddenly needed hot water.
