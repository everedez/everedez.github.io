    The Inevitable Revolution The odds of beating David Puig were virtually zero. Lenny Dykstra was still playing well after getting off to a hot start with his bat. And with the departure of his catcher, Corey Hart, there was nobody for the Los Angeles Dodgers to have his back.
Puig and his family moved from San Diego to Arizona in the summer of 1998, and that move exposed the youth movement of the Dodgers to a whole different generation.

    The Case Of The Unexplained Missing Body Found In Water by: Jeffrey A Toth
An effort by the Italian and Italian-American communities to reach the next level of relations between them remains vital.
