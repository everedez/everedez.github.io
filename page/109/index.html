    Monday, September 07, 2012 The Seattle City Council is attempting to pass a motion calling for the closing of the Seattle Times &amp;quot;chicken&amp;quot; on the condition that they are not to print the following headline: &amp;quot;The Seattle Times and the State AG&amp;#x27;s Report on Chickens&amp;quot; because according to the editorial board of The Times, they are so gross, they should be buried as a reminder of the publication&amp;#x27;s ties to the chicken industry.

    Funeral Info Melancon Funeral Home, Inc. The entire Melancon family, without any exception, served their memories honorably. Even one of our staff members, Bob, when he was terminated from service at the funeral home, in memory of our beloved brother Wilfred Melancon, continued to honor us until our last breath. We could not ask for a better bunch of mourners.
The Funeral Home has done a superb job in making our site a very special place.

    In a show first seen on February 18, 2016, Johnny Dee gets his balls bashed by a couple of fellow stoners under the audience. The two guys are unknowns to the crowd; one stands with a speargun at his side and the other grips a machete. Johnny pushes one of the downers towards one of them, and decides to go for the throat. But his back is to the audience, and he sees that it’s actually an airplane.

    About The path of this blog is to share my experience of living in the modern world, whether it be observing daily life and experiencing its trials and tribulations; or the highs and lows of relationships, the art and science of sex, or other such stories.
I have had three blogs before this one. The first is called Deception of the Pavement, where I described the problems I had with being a non-believer, and I referred to the one I am sitting before as The Paradox.
