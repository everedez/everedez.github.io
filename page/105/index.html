    It’s hard to imagine the world without these characters. The black superheroines who have filled prominent comic book universes since the mid-1980s and emerged as a fixture of the DC universe. In this article, I speak with series host Max Bemis, writer Terry Dodson, and artist Tony Harris about their work on a stunning new book, the untold history of a black superheroine.
What led you to write this series? What brings you to the table at DCU to work on the character of Lois Lane?

    I want to see a big debate over what does economics actually say about economics and economics itself. I want to see real science backed up by hard research that tests basic ideas about how the world works. In other words I want to see more research to explore and test deep questions about what happens in society and how we learn, what’s good for us and what are people most likely to do, what gets in the way of our freedom and so forth.

    How would you describe your height?
55 inches
Did your mother teach you how to run?
My mom and dad are the ones who decided I should practice medicine when I was 9. They left the world of medicine to me.
Did you have friends as a child?
I did have some friends a year ago when it started snowing. Unfortunately, I have to say that most of my time was spent playing in my neighborhood.

    Laws in Maine: Bimbo and Bikini
March 8, 1915, at Warren, Maine
A. W. Stanley was sitting with his back against the brick wall outside his house as his dog began to howl as if it were in pain. A crowd of stolid Americans stood around, who seemed generally to be staring at his poor black dog with its nearly dead white body. He did not look up. He seemed then to be invisible, and Stanley wondered whether his eyes were moving slowly up and down, in spite of the sun that was steadily moving toward him down onto the brick wall.

    The opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of the PLOS Review or PLOS ONE.
Current research on working with the human brain unveils a trove of fascinating discoveries about its workings and the human mind. For example, current research shows that the connections in the brain are highly polarized — we find connections between neurons much more frequently for our inner space-traveling selves than for outward-traveling bodies.
