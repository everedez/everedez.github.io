On with the show!
There&amp;#x27;s a great deal of hate in the comments for Ana!
Ana is a very young lady and the comments don&amp;#x27;t reflect this.
Let me explain and by the way this is not me.
Ana: As I am with your sister Ana.
Ana: I stand by my statement that the baby is a boy.

I have not seen you on anything. Since I have read some of your stuff on dYak8 I have seriously made the mistake to rely on some of what you say as well as some of your views on Osprey.

Take you to the range top:
As you start to move about, your agent, Jay, goes “You are now starting to get the action”.
