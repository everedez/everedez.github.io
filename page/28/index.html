    &amp;quot;These people say that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over, that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over, that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over; that&amp;#x27;small groups only&amp;#x27; try to take over.&amp;quot; - Mao
This is the single biggest lie I heard today, but it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily the most shocking. It is no longer the case that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s largest companies have been on the wrong side of the war on terror, but that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s leaders are still trying to keep that from happening.

    Owen Bennett Edward Snowden, has as much direct guilt as the families and victims of mass shootings.
He would be living a better life if he had come out as gay, or, even better, identified as one. That he did not reveal his true sexuality to the government in a line of questioning by the FBI, by participating in NSA surveillance programs, and by the security theater he practiced on the American people instead of making a living and gaining a military career, will never be erased.

    The owner of a British supermarket chain was jailed for five years for trading on his sex with young girls he caught holding secret meetings in his back garden with two men he &amp;quot;supposedly found attractive&amp;quot;. The 23-year-old, who was convicted of five offences under the Sex Offences Act, also made a £45,000 payment into bank accounts linked to the site where the scheme was uncovered.
David Cameron vowed to rejail Mr Mottola - a successful solicitor from Finsbury Park, north London - within the next four years.
