<h1>Rabbi Joshua Kahn</h1>
<p>Jews who advocate for gender equality are putting a woman-of-God at risk; creating an army of women to protect what they call their &amp;quot;shradim&amp;quot; should they fail to act.</p>
<p>Nitzan Shah, 37, from southern Israel was with her husband on the train to Emek Refaim last week when her right hand, first off the train, started to turn into a gun.</p>
<p>It looked like a suicide vest but she had lost time while digging into a bag. Now the gun was on the train, she said she could not escape.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard the train going, so she stopped. When the doors closed, she said she heard a loud whooshing sound.</p>
<p>She thought it was the train on her left, so she walked on toward the opposite direction, without thinking any more. But as soon as she got to a window the train moved away.</p>
<p>&amp;#x27;I never thought about myself&amp;#x27;</p>
<p>Her husband was talking to her sister-in-law about the attack and they both said it looked like a suicide attempt. Instead of seeing her as a threat, they told her to simply identify who was in front of her.</p>
<p>She asked who was causing the sound and that of her husband then she went and sat down in the aisle.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a strange train and that they were trying to kill me but I never thought of myself as such”, Nitzan, now 37, told Haaretz.</p>
<p>She saw that the gun was not an automatic weapon but in fact a folding pistol, and she worried whether she would become a victim.</p>
<p>“If I told them I was a male it would be hard for them to take me to the hospital or the police,&amp;quot; she said.</p>
<p>She asked her friend to alert her family, but Nitzan said they didn&amp;#x27;t accept her.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s all crazy, it&amp;#x27;s insane,&amp;quot; Nitzan said. &amp;quot;They called and I called them but no one came. Of course the truth will help me get through this, but not to such a scale. But I didn&amp;#x27;t listen very carefully because I thought, &amp;#x27;My hands are just now reaching.&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;</p>
<p>She then told her parents about it.</p>
