<h1>Mid Pines Invitational</h1>
<p>March 10 - The Eastside Alliance was held at Pierz in Newport Beach. Unlike other Eastside events, the Eastside Invite, named after its western competitor, The Blue Lobster, was not held by any one alliance. The Eastside Alliance event has been held since the beginning of the year. The Grand Ballroom of Pierz was filled to capacity that day of the event, as many local high schools had large organizations at the tournament. The last time the tournament had the Eastside tradition, the Eastside Invite was held in The Blue Lobster&amp;#x27;s annual tournament the summer of 2008.</p>
<p>March 2 - The World University Weightlifting Championships was held at the OCS Gym on the College campus. The Women&amp;#x27;s Circuit Championship gave the athletes from the entire United States an opportunity to compete against international athletes from all over the world. It was the first time the UC Davis women had won an Olympic spot since the 1980 games. This was the first time that the women from Davis and nearby Sonoma County competed for an Olympic spot at the games.</p>
<p>February 28 - The Eastside Tour Classic was held at Pierz. This event did not yet exist, as it had never had a women&amp;#x27;s circuit event, the only event in the United States. The event was first held in 1951 as the Eastside Invite.</p>
<p>February 28 - The &amp;quot;Lobster vs. Lobster&amp;quot; competition was held at Pierz. The Eastside Classic was held on the women&amp;#x27;s circuit in the middle of January, just a few weeks before the women&amp;#x27;s circuit championships for the year. The event was in the small arena that was an official charity of the Eastside Alliance events in 2009.</p>
<p>February 27 - The Eastside Classic was held at Pierz. The Eastside Classic started only a few weeks later than the Eastside Invite did and featured more athletes. It also marked the first time the womenâ€™s circuit was held in January in Central California. The event did not provide an Olympic spot, but just the opportunity for the athletes from Davis and other surrounding communities to perform for the city of Newport Beach. The event had hundreds of athletes compete on a non-Olympic level.</p>
<p>February 26 - The 2013 Eastside Youth Challenge tournament was held at the OCS Gym on the College campus.</p>
