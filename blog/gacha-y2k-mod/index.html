<h1>Gacha Y2k Mod</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome back to another Gacha Mod! I first heard about this Gacha y2k version of Halloween from Blacksmith and decided to create my very own custom Gacha because I like the looks of this mod. I am trying to recreate a few of the looks I know and seen on our office before with the materials that we have already. This one comes along with the Halloween 2016 theme, the normal materials, and in a lot of what we wanted to do, I decided to also take a new and unique approach! I was thinking “Hey, I can make this kinda cool, I think this is a great idea”. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, I have never done anything like this before and I can only count this mod as a success if it will work. I will start out by saying to anyone who don’t like the look of the Halloween 2016 theme, that I am just trying something new, so you should feel free to look around or not to, I just want you to know that I am not trying to copy exactly any of the other Halloween Gacha’s you have seen because we want to do something totally new and unique!</p>
<p>From this perspective I want to show you how I was thinking about doing this together with the materials from the previous Halloween mod (jumping beanbag decorations and the black gummy slobber mold) and how we will combine them together. We have a lot of material for this one and we will make our own fabric for the decorations and to adhere our “mod” to them. This will give you the flexibility of choosing what you are going to make and the creativity that you can do with it. Let’s take a look for starters!</p>
<p>
Standard Edition materials and costumes<br>
Materials<br>
Black glitter material<br>
Shirt and vest<br>

Black leather glove<br>

Black leather and black leather wristbands<br>
Regular leather pants<br>
Black and gray eye-wear.<br>
