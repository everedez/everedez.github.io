There are few genres that are more deserved in terms of hype, anticipation and success than the Dish podcast. Yes, the product may have been available when we were playing around with the &amp;quot;Showcase&amp;quot; category on our RSS feeds. But, more and more - with the likes of John Lui, Jeremy Larkin, Alain Martineau and many other key Dish voices joining in - the podcast is becoming ubiquitous.">

<h1>Dish Perks Free Previews</h1>
<p>Featuring: Spam up to 200 SPAMS</p>
<p>Instant results preview</p>
<p>There are few genres that are more deserved in terms of hype, anticipation and success than the Dish podcast. Yes, the product may have been available when we were playing around with the &amp;quot;Showcase&amp;quot; category on our RSS feeds. But, more and more - with the likes of John Lui, Jeremy Larkin, Alain Martineau and many other key Dish voices joining in - the podcast is becoming ubiquitous.</p>
<p>My own investment in the Dish Team and watching the new show play out is as inspiring as one could imagine. In recent months I have seen the show gain maturity (in the mainstream, not just the niche), create more momentum and become a more popular destination.</p>
<p>A couple of things I have witnessed in recent months. First, the depth of talent showcased was truly astounding to see. Second, it had truly become something of its own. When asked what made me decide to do this, I didn&amp;#x27;t hesitate to answer: &amp;#x27;Because your fans are awesome!&amp;#x27;</p>
<p>(By supporters I mean those of you reading this today: It&amp;#x27;s because you can&amp;#x27;t forget that these fans are amazing, unique and, most importantly, here to support the Dish team! )</p>
<p>Now, for the format. The big picture, the background, the stories that are told - this is a host of the past. It really is. But, suffice to say - it&amp;#x27;s not just a podcast with clever guests, funny business tactics, funny writing etc. It also features those of us who enjoy a wider range of interests and conversation from mainstream-media cultures and beyond.</p>
<p>So, here we go. It&amp;#x27;s time to get to know the world of Dish over time. It&amp;#x27;s time for some questions.</p>
<p>1. What are you playing? Is there more you can tell us about?</p>
<p>Oh the details start to build. From the subtle and the subtlety, to an overload of detail and to the very basic interview technique.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s a big, huge podcast - some genres have limits in how much detail detail they might release. Dish calls it &amp;#x27;Ephemera&amp;#x27;. So, let&amp;#x27;s start easy this time, with the basics: You don&amp;#x27;t know how long you&amp;#x27;ll be in the show?</p>
