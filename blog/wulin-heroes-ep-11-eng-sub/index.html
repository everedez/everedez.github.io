<p>Shaun &amp;amp; Roy&amp;#x27;s unique boss fights!The core team has been reformed for its first outing since the cancellation of the original team. This time around we have the help of some old colleagues. After all they are the ones who make the fights more fun than just about anything!</p>
<p>While we would love for you to join us the core team would like for you to like us on facebook! Please follow! The game will be launch in QQQ on the 28th of February in Asia!</p>
<p>The target audience for this release is for 8-11th grade aged boys and girls wanting to expand their knowledge of what it takes to become a hero.</p>
<p>This video is Part 1 and Part 2, since there is an Easter Egg!!!!!! —</p>
<p>With the first installment we brought on Shaun and Roy, the new members joining the team for this project! However, not all of them fit just right when it comes to combat techniques, some of them have a very little knowledge of the fighting arts. While others are just really bad.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the shop we received an idea from a very funny man, Lallian. He saw the video on youtube by John Cheetham and suggested that we make this video series. The core team agreed with him and since then Shaun and his friend Roy were born, the rest is history!</p>
<p>The videos made it to the stage, there we got a chance for us to put them to the test with a very light load! There is much more to it than just simply making some goofy wacky fights.</p>
<p>We all have different roles in the world we live in, but we are all really one man&amp;#x27;s views of the world, hence the name. We&amp;#x27;re actually the leaders, all the others are just the followers. The team doesn&amp;#x27;t control the power but it does give us the opportunity to be pretty loose sometimes while keeping things a bit high.</p>
