<p>Editor’s note: We just completed an interview with Scott Gault of Lone Star Hockey about his options as the new general manager of the Minnesota Timberwolves. Today is the first of four quick pieces that will discuss the leadership qualities that have led him to being the next president and CEO of the franchise. This interview is available to read on the NewsRoom blog: https://mlisserobrazos.wordpress.com/2019/07/17/sgt-gault/ Today’s interview is also available to download as a digital file here.</p>
<p>Geoff Walker: You’ve had an interesting career in Minnesota. Tell us a little bit about your background and how you got involved with hockey and the Midwest communities.</p>
<p>Scott Gault: My dad started a local Minnesota hockey rink in the south part of our state. Hockey’s a pretty big local pastime in Minnesota. I guess the word that comes to mind is “memorial.” A lot of people don’t realize that Minnesotans keep their traditions alive by keeping their memories alive. It’s just a way of honoring those who have done a lot for our community.</p>
<p>We also have a cultural tradition of baseball and hockey, so it was an obvious direction. My dad loved working with guys who played hockey and he had a lot of memories of his late grandfather who was a really fine hockey player, so I took an interest in hockey, and a passion for hockey, and some of his old dad friends and guys that played hockey who he came to know over the years. So that’s kind of how I got into hockey, worked a couple jobs over the years to pay the rent and made a living, and continued to play hockey for a while.</p>
