<h2>History</h2>
<p>In our world, many things happened that may not be readily identifiable. One of those events was the creation of a magical world called the &amp;quot;Third Magic&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;The Third Dimension&amp;quot;. The entire earth, earth beneath the earth, was turned into a place of magic, and the people living in that magical world gradually became known as the Magi, or The Wise.</p>
<p>It was not long after this that some of the Magi, or those who deemed themselves to be somewhat &amp;#x27;wise&amp;#x27;, began to walk in secret and explored the world. But alas, they found that they were wanderers too: lost; more clever than them, but no wiser.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Magi finally gained some kind of success, began to spread their mysterious ways, and gradually spread out of secret underground caves of the Third dimension, called the Great Tunnels. It was from this secret underground world that they came to be called the wise. As more and more Magi began to use their magick, it soon became apparent that in this new world of magic, the Magi themselves, although much more powerful, were still seen as wanderers. After one particularly deadly night, the Magi began to doubt themselves and began to train harder, to become a little more skilled. But they still were not at all sure of themselves. What they had discovered was truly, truly amazing.</p>
<p>In the Third Dimension, the Great Tunnels led to a world, a world of magic. This is a world much more twisted and far more beautiful than our world, but is still mostly primitive.</p>
