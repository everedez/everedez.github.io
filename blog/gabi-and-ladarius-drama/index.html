<h1>Gabi And Ladarius Drama</h1>
<h3>Why Did They Create The Ladarius Drama and What Made It So Difficult To Create?</h3>
<p>A week before Game 1 of the NBA D-League Basketball Finals, there was an insane back and forth for 6 minutes about which rookie (Ladarius, possibly rookie (maybe rookie!)) was a better player. This brought back memories and even gave me all the push I needed to create a drama. This year, I spent six hours talking to both Ladarius and his family, discussing the possible in the history of sports drama and how much of a grown man this rookie was. People like you and me may not always remember our heroes, but we remember hard work, dedication and perseverance and we are the recipients of those things. So keep your perspective from the point of view of the player (which is Ladarius). And remember that a rookie, he’s not a grown man, he’s a rookie like all the rest of us.</p>
<p>Talking to Ladarius’ family, there were tears and hand motions that weirder than the basketball game and that was not surprising. It was not likely to ever see the results we want, so many may remember that from a fan’s perspective. But the heart goes out to the parents who loved all the guys from their “childhoods” but ended up spending many nights with Ladarius that no one knew. This is how my family reacted when I told them I was having this story about my old idol.</p>
<p>When I told them I was doing that story they were shocked. A few moments in the process I told them that after a great game back in the spring, I quit my job, I knew I was going to be a D-League star and I was going to have an exceptional season. So as this (Ladarius) kid experienced his rookie year, I asked “Who knows, maybe I will never see that future. But the truth of the matter is, I have known this kid since he came back from the D-League and he’s going to be the best young man who can experience. He’s not just a great player because of his talent, but because of his passion. I’m curious and I wanted to know if anyone thought he was special or if people knew that his passion and ability was what carried him into a great game.</p>
