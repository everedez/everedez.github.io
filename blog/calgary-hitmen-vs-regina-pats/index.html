<h1>Calgary Hitmen Vs Regina Pats</h1>
<h3>Early Game Preview: #3 BC Gives The Green AND Red Asses Much Hype</h3>
<p>LAS VEGAS - The Calgary Hitmen travelled to Las Vegas on December 9 for an 11th time starting in a 3-3 tie with the San Diego Sockers, but will be without another All-Star left wing. Alex Tanguay will miss Calgary this postseason with a leg injury, although defenseman Brenden Kichton practiced fully with the team in Wednesday&amp;#x27;s optional practices. The trip to the Bay can be seen as a good opportunity for Brian Propp, who is the son of former Hartford Whalers head coach (and still current Texas Ranger president) Mike Propp, who was the former Providence Bruins GM during the latter part of the Dennis Wideman era on the Be Good Whalers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the road trip to the West coast obviously could be a frustrating experience, and Calgary can try to squeeze more from the trip and create some more excitement for the hometown fans, especially with Tanguay out of the lineup. For the most part, though, it&amp;#x27;s tough to tell just how good this team as a whole has become, and by a few losses that will get tested. On the same token, the loss of Marc-Andre Bergeron could mean there is a high level of reliance on the pair of Brett Balcomb-Maxim Vinatieri for this year&amp;#x27;s core and the current players. This is an ideal time for some of the younger talent to step up and get some experience, especially on the blue line where the Vancouver Canucks are only one win from being the number one team in the NHL with 41 points.</p>
<p>As for the rivalry between these two teams over the years, the first was the longest going, the 10 points in any of the nine meetings, not including this one, having occurred in the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals. The first meeting between the two teams had many fans wondering exactly what each team was trying to accomplish, and we&amp;#x27;re finally in the present with Calgary having a real chance to achieve something (the title of Canadian Hockey League Leader), while the Rangers were the defending Champions and had won two straight series.</p>
<p>The Hitmen will face the Sockers in the first night game and Calgary will be heavy favourites in the Pacific Division.</p>
