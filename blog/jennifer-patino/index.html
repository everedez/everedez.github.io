I became deeply interested in Game of Thrones when I first saw the first trailer for season 1. I went to the library to look for more, but in the end, I didn’t bother. The first season of Game of Thrones was merely a bit of entertainment for myself. I thought it was pretty much like any TV show or book and I found it enjoyable, but I could care less about television or literature.">

<p>The Long, Strange Ride of Game of Thrones (coming early March)</p>
<p>By author Caitlin Hennessy</p>
<p>I became deeply interested in Game of Thrones when I first saw the first trailer for season 1. I went to the library to look for more, but in the end, I didn’t bother. The first season of Game of Thrones was merely a bit of entertainment for myself. I thought it was pretty much like any TV show or book and I found it enjoyable, but I could care less about television or literature. I read the first couple of books too, but I couldn’t care less about the best-selling novels. Having read the first 3 books when I was young, I was pretty certain that even if I continued to read them, I would continue to dislike the books.</p>
<p>I suppose it was inevitable that I would grow up reading books and learning about other books. And if I continued to read those books, I knew they wouldn’t stop me from becoming a writer.</p>
<p>Game of Thrones has always been a big part of my life, and my addiction to the show, books, television, and movies has lasted an astronomical 5+ years. So when I became a writer, I knew I also wanted to write my own series, and what better way to continue with that than as the author of the book that comes with the series?</p>
<p>I started writing the first book, King in New York City, due March 23 of this year, and I have already begun a sequel to it, released April 12, 2015. While the books are written as a series and serve as a stand-alone, this is not to say I wish they were never written as a series: I guess I’m an editor first, and a reader second.</p>
<p>If you’ve been lucky enough to be a part of Game of Thrones, you know the story: the family of an impoverished, exiled royal family that has not fared well and lives in a crumbling, middle class area of New York (I’ve been in NY since 2005, but no, I’m not an experienced Queens resident).</p>
