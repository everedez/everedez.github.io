<h1>Bailey Veitch</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>According to the University of San Francisco&amp;#x27;s 2000 census, Bailey Veitch lived on her family farm in southern California near Lake Havasu City for most of her adult life. Bailey was born in Florence, Italy, and lived there until the age of five, when she was sent to live with her paternal grandparents in Texas. Bailey later spent a few years in Chicago and then returned to Texas in 1960. During her residence with her grandparents, she attended different schools including Tyler Junior High, Kenwood, Park Avenue High, and Oak Cliff High in Texas.</p>
<p>Veitch worked for her family&amp;#x27;s property in the United States and Canada, until she was 22 years old, when she was hired by her father, a cattle rancher, in Oak Cliff, Texas, to work at the Oak Cliff Stockman&amp;#x27;s cooperative. After a year at Oak Cliff, Veitch moved to Lubbock, Texas, where she worked in the women&amp;#x27;s department of the Stockmen&amp;#x27;s Bank. Later that year, she moved to California and managed the ranch house. She was 36 years old at the time of her retirement in 1999.</p>
