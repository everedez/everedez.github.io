<h1>Rinko Swimsuit Card</h1>
<p>For others:</p>
<p>Models that have had over 200K (meaning they are over 200K Model before the Rinko Swimsuit Card was introduced) are allowed to submit new designs in that amount of time and aren’t subjected to having their figure ranked in the top 100 because the card was released in a period where R15+ figures were released, even if they did score higher then what the model needed as a rank.</p>
<p>This means that any male character must get a score within 10 points of where they put the male character they looked at.</p>
<p>When a model finishes the scoring process, they are rewarded by being rated with 10 points and at the end of the day, the female model must receive a score of 35 points, meaning there is no minimum requirement on their ranking or level because their figure did not need to be the 100th woman.</p>
<p>While many people don’t see this as a problem, we have had some models who never got an inch higher than the third place male figure they looked at regardless of how many hundred points they earned.</p>
<p>So now imagine if you have three male figures, two even if they are not required to be ranked first and second, and you can see that number drops down to 25.</p>
<p>With Rinko Swimsuit Card releases out there, many models can have multiple figures and never be in the top 100.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for a model like ScifiManga that has already worked with developers and to see their figure ranking drop all the way to the 20th spot is a bit shocking.</p>
<p>As the development team continues to fix bugs and work towards R15+ figures, it is possible that their time will get cut short and the ranking be lowered to as low as 100.</p>
<p>With this first wave of the release, ScifiManga really knew was up against it, the numbers were so low that the girls had high rankings and the men had to work hard to get there and make up the difference.</p>
<p>The developers wanted to make those men a bit tougher than the female figures to make it harder for the female models. After that, we were aiming to create a more dynamic video, something you hope that does not help you win.</p>
