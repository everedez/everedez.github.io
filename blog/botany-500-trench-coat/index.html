<p>Saw the product range with my eye too, but was disappointed in both, not sure which I will buy, and can see that on other websites for similar prices, but have got a wayyyy smaller panel size to show!</p>
<p>I really think its a great combo, both are beautiful and definitely both deserve their own fan club.</p>
<p>They are in stock for immediate shipment and delivery (within Australia if you buy online) but sadly I do not have any pictures to share of all the products inside my &amp;quot;shopping basket&amp;quot;?</p>
<p>I really do wonder - they are a little pricier for me!</p>
