Lore is a serious word (at least my mother&amp;#x27;s french is), so don&amp;#x27;t read too much into it.

<h1>Ryan Bader Deaf</h1>
<p>*Pony is owned by a business, not Ponybabe*, Ponybabe is owned by Pony Bader Deaf and neither parties expressly or implicitly warrant its accuracy or completeness.</p>
<p>Lore is a serious word (at least my mother&amp;#x27;s french is), so don&amp;#x27;t read too much into it.</p>
<p>[Edit: I asked @Dirty_Wigz&amp;#x27;s mother for a translation of this post, and she couldn&amp;#x27;t understand me asking him to translate it, so it didn&amp;#x27;t get fixed properly.]</p>

Like. Like _like_.<br>
A girl who kills a pony because it broke her heart.<br>
I knew I was in bad hands.<br>
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#x27;t move, turtle!&amp;quot;<br>
I was barely able to get that word out. She had an accent.<br>
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#x27;t move, turtle! What you want done to me?&amp;quot;<br>
She clearly had trouble with the english language.<br>
</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I told you, you hurt the pony. You hear me now? You hurt that pony! Do you hear? That pony is my mother&amp;#x27;s...</p>
<p>
The pony had let go of my right arm. The poor thing really didn&amp;#x27;t have the energy to fight me.<br>
&amp;quot;Get your hands off me!&amp;quot; He opened his eyes.<br>
I hadn&amp;#x27;t meant for him to fall that many times.<br>
I was in the middle of my own fight.<br>
What my mother could do was, laugh.<br>
&amp;quot;Mother couldn&amp;#x27;t take it, Pony. We both understand that.<br>
&amp;quot;What he looks like, me, can you recognize him?&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;He&amp;#x27;s...?&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;Are you telling me my pony husband is going to attack you?&amp;quot;<br>
I was going to die anyway, so I figured I&amp;#x27;d answer honestly.<br>
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;<br>
There was a moment of silence after that.<br>
And then he said, no, he wasn&amp;#x27;t going anywhere that day.<br>
&amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#x27;t you kill the pony?&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;She was my mother&amp;#x27;s!&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>That really explained it. Thank you, Ponzy! Can now see why my pony&amp;#x27;s name was Pony&amp;#x27;s, even if he had little Pony by itself.</p>
<p>The girl who was responsible for my abduction was older than me.</p>
