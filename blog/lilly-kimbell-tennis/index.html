<h1>Lilly Kimbell Tennis</h1>
<p>&amp;quot;I Was Born In 1970 As A Girl&amp;quot;  [This is a quote from a statement at a rally following the 1984 U.S. Men&amp;#x27;s Nationals in Munich. I was only 10 years old at the time]</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Welcome To Wimbledon!&amp;quot; said the Wimbledon Tour official. I was sitting there in the stands all excited. Then the announcers started introducing a young black and white girl in a rain coat and pink hat, and I was like, &amp;quot;Where did this girl come from? Why did we call her a rain coat?&amp;quot; She&amp;#x27;s like, &amp;quot;All I need to do to win in tennis is touch my right forehand every time I land on the ball for the purpose of landing the shot I choose. I&amp;#x27;m a slow, sloppy, amateur player by day, amateur ballhandling at the racket by night.&amp;quot; I was like, &amp;quot;No, this is more than that. She&amp;#x27;s a highly competitive person.&amp;quot; She&amp;#x27;s sitting down in the audience with her mom and father and mother-in-law, all right?</p>
<p>Then out of this comes a tall, young man, a friend of my mother&amp;#x27;s who went to Central School of Chicago and was a big contributor to my mom and dad&amp;#x27;s careers. She was sitting at home when I started getting interested in tennis, and I was sitting there and was like, &amp;quot;Do you know what sports are?&amp;quot; You know, we used to watch so few sport tapes back when I was growing up. I saw all this high school football on Monday Night Football and Wednesday Night Football. The stars of high school football was young guys on the &amp;quot;Fonz&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Harvard&amp;quot; line at the time. So I thought, like, &amp;quot;Here&amp;#x27;s an example of what the modern game looks like. Let&amp;#x27;s call it tennis.&amp;quot; We started watching a bunch of college tennis from my friends and my moms and my dad&amp;#x27;s friends. They were amazing. These were people having fun, not stressing over going to the singles tourney at the time. They didn&amp;#x27;t go to a singles tourney with a deadline to win. I watched these guys who were playing at the level of high school tennis players play competitively, and I had my eye on one of them.</p>
<p>He was a senior at Northwestern at the time who was a two-time NCAA National Champion and a World Tennis magazine Champion. He won 4 times.</p>
