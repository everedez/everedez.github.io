<h1>Ta Nehisi Coates Superman</h1>
<p>Recently, a super hero was born and I was very excited to be part of his birth. In researching the birth I was surprised to find a link to a Mr. Nefarious trying to kill Superman. Not an original idea for a web series, but an idea with the potential to be very exciting. When Mr. Nefarious had his bomb at my house, I was determined not to let him kill Superman but I did manage to pick up quite a few things! As one is always prepared for, I have repurposed the art I had created for the Superman Birth Day website into a web comic book which is now available as of December, 2012!</p>
<p>
One of the things I was very excited to see was the picture of Lex Luthor giving birth to the Pottstown Raccoon.<br>
See the birth certificate?<br>
M.N.F.A.P.<br>
B.A. in Art Administration – BA in Interior Design<br>
T.S.A.R. (Transparent Structural Adjustable Restraint)<br>
N-Alpha Theta Gamma<br>
</p>
<p>I might not have shared the birth certificate, but I did discover that there was also a picture of one of Superman&amp;#x27;s fellow Superfriends arriving at M.N.F.A.P.&amp;#x27;s office, in the same plane. It was very cool.</p>

<p>I had not really thought about the picture of the Superfriends in the same plane as Superman&amp;#x27;s friends until I noticed they were next to a logo of the Science Camp, to which he and Supergirl were attending.</p>
<p>
See the Super Friends?<br>
I also saw them in the same gallery as Superman<br>
