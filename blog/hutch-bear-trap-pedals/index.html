<h1>Hutch Bear Trap Pedals</h1>
<p>Product Description:The new 4×4 clutch pedal is the best way to make heavy duty track-legal mechanical pedals with a faster response. A friction pad helps transfer the weight of your foot to the pedal. It will increase your pedal range dramatically. The patented foot-grounding system allows you to balance the weight from both your foot and frame effortlessly. The redesigned D-shaped unit has a new C-clip which rotates locking tabs under the pistons.</p>
<p>D-clips with integrated pistons that grip them firmly in place.</p>
<p>Invented and designed by Bill Hannigan and John Wheeler</p>
<p>Aircraft and road bikes are not usually made for “clutch on, clutch off”. But a clutch pedal in a pedal-powered bike must work really well and have the perfect amount of clutch. In my opinion, the best clutch pedal is the 4×4 clutch pedal designed by Bill Hannigan and John Wheeler of Bell Equipment, Inc. (who are teaming up with H-D bicycle for the development of a new “old style” 3×3 gear drive system). The new clutch system can be read as follows:</p>
<p>The new 3×3 system—which will be available in both manual and “manual on, clutch off” configurations—is based on a simple old stand-alone drive wheel and a “manual” system using up to four clutches to lock or unlock a chain. The manufacturer claims that you can adjust the clutch pedal speed to the range of 3-12/4-12 which means a 20-degree range, which is more or less in line with what the original 3×3 system. I estimate that a 4×4 clutch pedal should be able to lock down the rider at speed (6-30/4-30). But all the individual gear ratios—not just “old school” ratios—can be adjusted and fine-tuned to fit the rider’s pedal range, ergonomics, or trail. The most important thing is to choose a pedal that will do both the “right” and “the ’right” amount.</p>
