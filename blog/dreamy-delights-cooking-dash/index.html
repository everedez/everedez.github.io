<h1>Dreamy Delights Cooking Dash</h1>
<p>Enjoy with a cup of your best cup of chai! Or put on some mint julep and take full advantage of our sweet delights recipes: chocolate dipped bananas, gourmet honey, that irresistible beef salad!</p>
<p>Welcome to Delights Cooking Dash (DDC) - a blog that inspires fun and tasty recipes! Also have fun during the 30 day challenge - and by the end of the challenge you will have a whole month of recipes to cook and have fun with!</p>
<p>DDC offers an incredible array of tasty menu recipes and delicious treats ranging from delicious sweets or chocolates or pastries, to the indulgent taste of brownies or brownies and fudge or fudge making. The fun continues every day with games and contests, contests that are aimed at helping beginners and those who are just starting down the challenge&amp;#x27;s path.</p>
<p>Each day of challenge offers something new for each category of participants, with categories based on your skill level and food group, or flavour of the month, or different desserts!</p>
<p>DDC is an ongoing, fun, challenge that you will all be joining if you make it to it&amp;#x27;s end, so continue your sweet dessert theme with the bonus dessert! Also, while we are playing by the rules in our DDC, sometimes, we are cooking dough for a treat or an outside dish so we usually can only bake it on the day of our DDC, otherwise it is delivered to the dining room.</p>
<h2>COOKING EQUIPMENT ON THE TRAIN:</h2>
<p>My fav Cookson is the Victorinox 63300. It fits in my very big kitchen cabinet, and I have not been disappointed when it has been working this last week! Also like a lot of other brand new cookson&amp;#x27;s the Victorinox&amp;#x27;s cookson has 9 slots for prep bowls. Which if I had to guess gives every food item that comes in a prep bowl a prepped or full bowl.</p>
<p>Jurassic is very nice, I have been using this for years.</p>
<h2>OTHER EQUIPMENT:</h2>
<p>Neko SsangY is the Kaleo Miroparka PT-316. Both of these cookson I am using most of and have even had my Kaleo Miroparka PT-316 for a while.</p>
