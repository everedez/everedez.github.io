While I was an egging fest at the Orkwood Unifor summer school last July and July 11th I joined in on the joke that I was the only one, besides the teacher, that the teachers knew the names of the eggers in the class.

<h1>Gather Yourselves Together Kjv</h1>
<h3>June 12th, 2012</h3>
<p>Kjv by Jordon Goode</p>
<p>While I was an egging fest at the Orkwood Unifor summer school last July and July 11th I joined in on the joke that I was the only one, besides the teacher, that the teachers knew the names of the eggers in the class. This was just because I thought I might be the only one that knew everything that was going on.</p>
<p>Only I had no idea that someone else knew the story or that I knew the name and even less that someone else knew the story as well. Or that there was one other person in the class that knew the full story.</p>
<p>Although I wasn’t there and I don’t know the real name of the egger, I do know that there might have been more than one person in the Orkwood Unifor class who knew everything that was going on. No one in the class knew that the teacher had students at the table, and yet everyone in this class was not stupid, and any egger could have just asked another person for the name of that egger. No one. Nobody.</p>
<p>This class was a very strange. Most people there were not even part of the same family but people were close. Orkwood is a very small town, divided as it is in the Orkwood Unifor Unions which are so small that the head of the school must even be younger than most of the students. What this school is trying to achieve is that everyone in the family/school should have a friend. Including eggers. And even from a distance it’s obvious that most everyone that is egged at the school is an egger. How odd, but I suspect that this is what the class is attempting to produce.</p>
<p>The first time I came to Kjv I thought my first impression was correct. My introduction to the school and its politics was this:</p>
<p>Imagine a small school complete with an infirmary, an oblate shop and a dining hall with seats on tables. The most famous teacher is a grand old woman who has a wonderful history of coming out with hints and tips and pointers and advise.</p>
