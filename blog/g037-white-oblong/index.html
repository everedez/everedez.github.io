For an even more entertaining time, why not put this plush pumpkin head together? An easy, one-touch Pumpkin Head is made of a hard plush with a soft gel head and a colorful pumpkin body. It is super easy to assemble; just swap out the doll face and tail, and you’re finished. Also in your hands is a gift box (with same height and width as the head) of 50 new and gently used (skelly to name it) plush animals!">

<p>For an even more entertaining time, why not put this plush pumpkin head together? An easy, one-touch Pumpkin Head is made of a hard plush with a soft gel head and a colorful pumpkin body. It is super easy to assemble; just swap out the doll face and tail, and you’re finished. Also in your hands is a gift box (with same height and width as the head) of 50 new and gently used (skelly to name it) plush animals! Enjoy.</p>
<p>It just takes one hour to set (used materials, not included) and just 8-16 hours of play to complete, so you have some sweet time to enjoy your own (not stuffed) pumpkin head. Add this one with this cotton “C”.</p>
<p>This pattern is very cute and easy and pretty easy to build, but a 3-layer print doesn’t always mean it is the exact same thing. We have 5/6 pattern pictured but have 1/3 sizes in use.</p>
<p>This pattern is compatible with Universal Robots, Universal Robots or any new Universal Robots coming out in 2019</p>
<p>Check out one of these 5 different patterns and some pictures of some specific prints:</p>

<p>My opinions are my own and are not meant to offend people&amp;#x27;s race, religion, &amp;amp;/or gender. The only reason I link it back to you guys is because I hope you guys will like it and want to help me spread the word!</p>
