<h2>The Damned Darkadelic</h2>
<p>When the group of adventurers arrived, the camp was utterly silent. The animals they had left as guard had left them as they ran away to join the forest creatures of their enemy. They had hoped to surprise something and perhaps find some clue to where they had hidden the treasures they sought, but had they succeeded they would not have been surprised that they made no such find. The animals had fled before them in utter disgust, vowing in turn their own desertion should they ever encounter their enemy.</p>
<p>They had arrived in the place called Elsira. The thick forest of tall, growing trees in the eastern part was only sparsely populated aside from several groups of small forest creatures which the adventurers had seen. The forest here abutted on to the first mountain before dropping down to the forest below. This mountain had the name Elsira and surrounded it were several small towns, one called Fesyn the woods, the other Palmor the forest.</p>
<p>They had come from the east, from the lands of Middle Elfar which the elfling had named in memory of the noble warrior lost in battle five years past. The elves had made an alliance with the dwarves - which extended into their own realm - to defend them against their enemies which were called the Dunmahata. The alliance was named after a rock demon that had tried, but failed, to conquer all the forests of Middle Elfar in one night. The rock demon had the name Elsira, but had his own culture named after him. The name of the rock demon himself had two other names which spoke directly to the elves: Eltamell and Gewelden.</p>
<p>The elves had come here from the mountains where the Forest of Fire stood, and had taken out one dragon, one ice spirit and seven undead dwarves. They had taken two of their allies as well. In the battle they had lost the elfling in the attack and the two ice beings they turned and slain, but succeeded in killing at least one orc. The one undead dwarf they had killed was a man named Qun with his head shaved.</p>
<p>Elsira had been the first land that the archers of the elves set eyes on.</p>
