<h1>Bryce Scalf Accident</h1>
<p>The accident was occurring within the last 2 hours of that night and came to national attention on BBC as the paramedics had to separate one of the two people being hurt (either by police or from Scalf by fire) to treat the others due to the delay in being able to tend to the injured and assist the injured man. An earlier story has been put on here-</p>
<p>An earlier version of this post stated that the accident occurred at Broadstone, which technically is Broad Street, not Broadstone. It is more likely a mistake about Broadstreet as the Broadstone road name does not exist, and a previous post put Broad streets in Birmingham, which have many people just call Broadstone.</p>
<p>The other side of the story is it&amp;#x27;s not the two people that have been injured, like the other stuff that has been reported by another post, but what happened afterwards. There was a fire alarm system coming down which was tripped by someone apparently getting a cab, it activated but when it was finally stopped it was put into service again where it was tripped again. This has now become a YouTube video which we&amp;#x27;ve embedded below. In the video people of all ages are saying that they had to wait after the second alarm and again the paramedic was separate from people before he could take people to the hospital, one also has to wonder if it was connected with the ambulance being delayed on the day as one of the victims said in the video that they had to wait until his one and only ambulance did arrive on time on the scene and then from there they had to take him to the hospital.</p>
<p>The first incident is set to the left. The second the right. The patient has been separated from the others and taken first to the hospital and then this latest footage was taken and that&amp;#x27;s it. We do really hope that all this information becomes known. We&amp;#x27;d certainly like to hear how it was all done.</p>
<p>This is a major accident that needs to be investigated. The first of the following links will get you to a chatroom with people trying to figure out the aftermath. All the best.</p>
