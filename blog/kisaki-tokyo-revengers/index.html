<h1>Kisaki Tokyo Revengers</h1>
<p>The Rejector (Showa series #63)</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>The Rejector has kidnapped the human world, and he intends to possess a powerful space vessel in order to complete his plan; just before he does so, the vessel crashes into the surface of Earth. The Rejector’s plan is to absorb all of humanity into his space vessel, but something goes wrong, and some very powerful things show up, namely an army of Gashapon and Kamikaze robots designed to absorb and revive entire armies. A human with a working brain implants is being hailed as the reincarnation of the true world that will one day be abandoned. The Rejector does not want this new world, and his only intention is to acquire a huge sum of money from the profits they can make selling themselves as new space-faring lives in a new, improved world.</p>
<p>And just like before, the Rejector believes that humans may be useful in his scheme to return the world to an abandoned state. This time, however, it is the world in which humans will be able to live after their disappearance.</p>
<h2>Kara Yuzuki</h2>
<h3>Possible Birth:</h3>
<p>Kara Yuzuki is the daughter of a shopkeeper living in a town in the sea of Japan. Her mother died while young, and she was raised by her aunt, who raised her as a younger sister. She has an idea of doing odd jobs like selling fruit cakes, with her aunt as her manager. Many years later, she was living in an industrial area where she had her own construction business.</p>
<p>She becomes the target of the Rejector who wanted a deal with him. This was because Yuzuki hoped that he would make her a member of a powerful company from the military. She had been sold a load of old technology which would make her powerful if she could help him get a huge sum of money from the world. This got her a lot of people. With that, she realized that her people were less than ready to support her in what she had to do. She was accepted as a subject, along with another person whose only plan was to survive in the Rejector’s machine.</p>
<p>The Rejector’s plan was extremely difficult to finish, and things would go from bad to worse as the time went on.</p>
