<h1>Viselus Empires And Puzzles</h1>
<h3>Monday, June 14th, 2019:</h3>
<p>Tonight I present the latest article from ChessBase by their webmaster Dennis Beniston which is a puzzle update that discusses the state of white pieces in the Solitaires, Khans of the Golden Age, Ruy Lopez, and many other solitaires around the world. I’ll leave to you the puzzles on the Solitaires, Khans of the Golden Age, and Ruy Lopez that you haven’t yet read and hope to do in the future. Dennis Beniston is the player who presented all the puzzles of the Solitaires from the inception of the game to the final closure of the Battle of Karpaty, as part of the annual Montreux Masters tournament series. If you live or play chess anywhere in the world, or are looking for a stimulating challenge, check out this article! This article is an entry in their “In The Chess Universe” series which is designed to spark a period of reflection on the chess history of today and how it compares with chess’s history of the past – primarily 1500-2000 years ago. If you have a question you’d like answered, and especially if you are new to chess but would like to read an update on some of the puzzles so far, leave comments below, or email me through the Contact page on the website.</p>
<p>Puzzle Update: Solitaires, Khans of the Golden Age</p>
<p>The article has a few well-known puzzles – Solitary, the Sistren’s Hall of Honor, the Petford, and the White Knights. The other well-known puzzles below, and those on the Solitaires (which I didn’t blog enough about recently).</p>
<p>When I won the tournament in Kiev, I had earned the distinction of becoming the first in the world to win the Grandmaster title, a distinction accorded to four English knights in the same year by Charles Nunn in 1926. On that occasion, I was officially appointed as Grandmaster, and on two more occasions was awarded the title “Chess Champion” in the same year. Thus, after this latest tournament victory, that title still exists under the authority of Grandmaster Dmitry Orlov.</p>
