<h1>Dylan Ferrandis Wreck</h1>
<h3>Monday, September 07, 2012</h3>
<p>The Seattle City Council is attempting to pass a motion calling for the closing of the Seattle Times &amp;quot;chicken&amp;quot; on the condition that they are not to print the following headline: &amp;quot;The Seattle Times and the State AG&amp;#x27;s Report on Chickens&amp;quot; because according to the editorial board of The Times, they are so gross, they should be buried as a reminder of the publication&amp;#x27;s ties to the chicken industry. The Seattle Times released an editorial which argues, almost completely accurately, that any reporting on the industry needs to keep that hidden.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize award winning journalist Robert Fife, who penned the stunning article and the accompanying editorial at the Seattle Times, didn&amp;#x27;t write this article, it was edited by Ben Templesmith, author of a more recent cover story (&amp;quot;Seattle Times Charges With Ties to One of Largest Chicken Pits in America&amp;quot;) which concludes that like most poultry producers the relationship between The Times and the industry is &amp;quot;strained&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>The report conducted by the State Attorney General concludes that The Seattle Times and the National Poultry Association created a fake chicken industry when they chose to publish a story about problems at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in the Seattle area. The reporting concluded that The Times had misled the public about the extent of the problem.</p>
<p>
The Seattle Times and the State Attorney General concluded that the<br>
media coverage was misleading. The Times had presented a false portrayal of Chick-fil-A and the industry. The Times had represented Chick-fil-A as helping to develop business and<br>
as creating job opportunities without providing the opportunities to attract consumers.<br>
</p>
<p>The State Attorney General concluded it was Chick-Fil-A&amp;#x27;s failure to incorporate properly into its food operation that caused the problem at its restaurant near Lake Washington. Chick-fil-A fails to consider the company&amp;#x27;s mission in providing wholesome and well-priced food, whether its serves the needs of its customers or not.</p>
<p>
The last paragraph of the report explains this point.<br>
The coverage also concluded that The Times lied to the public about the nature of The Chick-fil-A&amp;#x27;s ownership<br>
through its political sources and<br>
through its executive vice president of corporate<br>
affiliations.<br>
This year, over the objections of the Washington Ethics<br>
Commission, three newspapers in the state will continue operating unless the legislature puts an end to the practice.<br>
