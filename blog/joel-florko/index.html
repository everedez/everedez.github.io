<h1>Joel Florko</h1>
<p>
Twelve months ago, on February 11th, 2011 we witnessed the murder of one<br>
and murdered two more four years ago we saw the murder of twelve people<br>
seven days ago we saw the murder of thirteen people six days ago we saw<br>
the murder of fourteen people twelve days ago we saw the murder of nineteen<br>
people that should have happened two years ago.<br>
Two years after the first anniversary of this mass murder– we saw<br>
what became a searing horror moment for black freedom fighters here in<br>
the United States. I, Joel Florko, have family members now based in<br>
California who witnessed those two murders of Keith Lamont Scott in<br>
Baltimore. For those of you doing the research, that is Jeffrey Scott<br>
who was murdered by the Baltimore police last Wednesday night at 4:25<br>
pm after he refused to allow them to forcibly arrest him for attacking<br>
a police officer with a knife. As far as I know, there has not been a<br>
police murder in Baltimore in a month. The first reported incident<br>
surrounded a twenty second walk sign by the protestor, had the<br>
opportunity to display a death by cop when Scott shouted “I’m not<br>
fucking with you’ from where I was standing. The next scene was the<br>
start of a car chase from close range through a close range police<br>
kill zone a witness says had the intent to kill, which is hardly an<br>
exaggeration, witness reports the car raced through a number of gates<br>
as people were attempting to get out, they had just returned from<br>
an escape from another protest. Scott’s girlfriend, a 27 year old<br>
Maryland state trooper (murdered last August in Richmond), her live<br>
breath trapped between two cars as the pursued car jumped the ramp<br>
and attacked her, Scott ran off and was found by police with a large<br>
number of knife wounds on his body, they forced him to the ground<br>
and opened him up with gunfire (video here: http://dailycaller.com/video/ex-wife-tells-rape-accuser-after-his-suicide-video ).<br>
