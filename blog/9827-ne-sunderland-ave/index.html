<h3>Comments:</h3>
<p>Update: We just had a text and call with the owner, he said he didn’t know who the driver was at all. The police were very rude to him and demanded he answer their phone. They threatened for him to move into a hotel close to his house. He’s very angry, he had a truck parked on his street, in violation of city codes. His phone is going to take some time, he’s apparently concerned about getting evicted. He felt embarrassed, but not too disappointed he didn’t get away with the whole thing. he didn’t report it, just got pulled over. Also he mentioned he was “hoping to get evicted”. His husband had a relative that he was hoping to get evicted too. The owner offered them his mobile phone number though, but he was turned away and so told him that it’s not the right time to come to him. Overall though, very frustrated with the situation and hoping to move out soon.</p>
