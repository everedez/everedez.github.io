Okay, well given all the hype I haven&amp;#x27;t really touched it recently. However, things really don&amp;#x27;t look promising for it to continue on its path to growth as a world-wide infrastructure. It also looks to already have what some of us on the Bitcoin Cash/litecoin team are starting to call a &amp;quot;blockchain fatigue&amp;quot; issue, where it&amp;#x27;s becoming harder and harder to convince others to switch over to it because it&amp;#x27;s so slow, opaque, complicated or annoying.">

<p>So I was excited with the news that it &amp;quot;sent&amp;quot; bitcoins to a Netherlands company, but sadly it appears the Netherlands company was not using the platform to legally send the bitcoins to their bank.</p>
<p>Although, the situation has not been revealed up close. Still lots more to read.</p>
<p>The project lists 16 addresses. Note that I did take all the other addresses into consideration (1 bitcoin + 10 for the BitGo company, one for the Netherlands company and one for two Dutch NEP-TLD&amp;#x27;s which were developed in combination with the BitGo company, with one being a Bitcoin address and one being a NEP-TLD. I then went with bitcoinexts.net), some of which don&amp;#x27;t seem to be connected directly to a physical bitcoin address.There has been no official announcement that this project will run on the bitcoin blockchain. In fact my understanding is that it won&amp;#x27;t.The project lists 16 addresses.
