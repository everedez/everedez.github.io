<h1>Risen Crimson Glow Valstrax</h1>
<p>(See below for details.)</p>
<p>The Valstrax is a custom version of the Crimson Elite that the Guren have brought back. However, this new version of the Crimson Elite is heavily modified and imbued with her abilities.</p>
<p>Equipment: The Valstrax&amp;#x27;s equipment is comprised of custom armor and weapons, and it can also be worn as a pendant like many of the Crimson Elite versions.</p>
<p>Pendants allow the Valstrax a much greater effect than Guren costumes. In combination with the armor, this pendant provides the Guren an invulnerability, protection, and attack +1 that all Crimson Elite versions provide. It also allows a more vulnerable and vulnerable Guren to be worn without feeling like a vampiric bait.</p>
<p>The pendant also has the trait that if you activate a Crimson Elite version, Guren will become invincible to anything other than the primary Crimson Elite Version. This makes it very dangerous to the player with the primary version on.</p>
<p>As long as the player is within the range of the Valstrax&amp;#x27;s aura, Guren will still feel a little vulnerable. They will remain somewhat vulnerable, as they will not feel invulnerable.</p>
<p>However, Guren will be protected against the aura against being able to stand in a way that would allow others to notice them, with Guren remaining invulnerable to items and others. In theory, this would prevent others from bullying Guren into using them against them.</p>

<p>The armor wears two different types of Nagashite. The Nagashite that the Guren wear is based off the new Crimson Elite armor, similar to how we introduced it in the Silver Base version. The armor is inspired by the blue Nagashites that we use for our Harpy and toasts.</p>
<p>Each Nagashite has its own unique traits and abilities, making it harder for a Guren to successfully equip a Nagashite armor than a regular one. It also has 3 items of equipment that allow the player to equip it as they wish.</p>
