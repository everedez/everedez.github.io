<h1>1675 Farrell Rd Sanford Nc</h1>
<h3>80 North Main St.</h3>
<p>Buried in our neighborhood&amp;#x27;s epic pile of unmarked debris lies the crumbling remnants of the 13.6 million BSA 4.6-billion-dollar construction project. The proposed Monterey II, now shrouded in a soggy, twisted pile of concrete on a concrete pad, was slated to bring Monterey County’s once-booming agriculture and tourism industry to their knees in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>A hastily assembled planning commission didn’t have the staff, permits and resources to implement the proposed development through the entire first 40 months of a plan to convert this former gas pipeline and warehouse into an oil- and fertilizer-fueled mini-city.</p>
<p>Isolated towns with no locally based economic backbone would quickly crumble, crippling the development dream of the early ’80s.</p>
<p>“We had a $17 billion company, and it suffered through one year because of financial constraints and we had a giant bureaucracy. Did we even have the money to apply for permits? Maybe it was budget-neutral,” said Steve King, the former city administrator.</p>
<p>“I am a pragmatic person. I do what needs to be done to get this done. I think we did the right thing.”</p>
<p>The project required 500 approvals, or about a person per hour, according to a former city manager, as “troublemakers” opposed it. Officials tried one option after another, from creating a new department to laying off 13,000 workers (it was eventually, only 8,000) to having people do the work. Each time, officials fell behind.</p>
<p>One application that the city began on Jan. 17, 1987, took two years; another application, dated Feb. 21, 1990, was launched on the same day.</p>
<p>“We felt bad for the people who were affected in the downtown area by the project,” King said. A small group of concerned citizens, he said, organized a site visit to Monterey and met with former Project Managers James Owens and Fred Lavelle.</p>
<p>A building permit was also necessary.</p>
<p>“We were expecting the building of a steel building that would be the only type in Monterey County,” King said.</p>
