<h1>Aot Skid Marks</h1>
<p>Cops were dispatched to the Aot Skid Marks on Beach Road and all lanes were closed between 27th and Emsden due to minor truck lane incident.</p>
<p>A moment later drivers were exiting and turning onto Beach Road from the Beach Road exits when the AOT skid marks occurred.</p>
<p>The location is approximately 4/5 mile south of the cross island boundary on Beach Road, directly across from East Beach Road.</p>
<p>The on-coming driver was unclear as to the impact of the Skid Marks on her vehicle, but the drivers were cited for a lane violation.</p>
<p>As a result, Beach Road will be closed south of the island as the road is cleared of debris so the roadway is considered clear through 3PM.</p>
<p>St. John’s County Police are investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Last week, a minor collision along Beach Road was reported but no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>A road reconstruction operation is anticipated near the end of this week to correct the driving conditions on Beach Road to eliminate the recent AOT skid marks.</p>
<p>“If this happens regularly that’s definitely not a good sign,” said Eric Flatt, an engineer with the St. John’s County Highway Department.</p>
<p>“From my point of view, (it’s) very much one of the reasons for getting the road resurfacing in place,” said Mr. Flatt.</p>
<p>“We’re making it a conscious effort, and that’s what we’re doing, there’s a lot of clearing going on in the area to reduce future damage,” said Mr. Flatt.</p>
<p>“I hope that we get ahead of it. I’m not blaming anyone.”</p>
<p>Beach Road will be closed south of the island to stop debris from piling up into the road – the lane is closed as well, so drivers will be forced to exit for Beach Road.</p>
<p>“Anything left over is a potential hazard to drivers going east towards Emsden, so that’s a different situation to be in here,” said Mike Olson, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>“At this particular time the road is still shut down.</p>
