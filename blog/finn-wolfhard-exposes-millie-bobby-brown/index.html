<p>I have just recently learned that my friend and fellow author, Dr. Finn Wolfhard, had a young lady of minor beauty at the helm of his Mollie Roth Books. Her name is Millie Bobby Brown. Millie was a high school senior at the time and her minor was Mollie Roth. The Mollie Roth is widely credited as the most quoted novel ever written! Millie starred in the Mollie Roth adaptation, from what I read, which changed the cultural climate of publishing in the sixties to say the least. With her face on covers everywhere. Millie was a proud undergraduate and graduate of Princeton for many of her twenties.</p>
<p>So my question to Finn on the Mollie Roth cover is this: “Who’s to know?” So many women, including myself, have never actually heard the story of someone making a story public that many fans would take as gospel for us, but not Finn. How could Millie think that Finn had nothing but good intentions, and how could Millie take that leap of faith and go public with such a story that she thought it was so important to share? It makes you wonder about how many other people just jump up on a platform with a huge public following, think it’s so cool to shine a light on our peers. To be the one among many, I have no doubt, but what about when a public story comes on as kind of a celebrity, and it turns out all that was just a fad to impress people and was not really anything? A nice hit and miss that really highlights our peers. A simple outing with big attention seeking and attention seeking followers. A “look how cool I am” kind of an outing. We will always make mistakes and we will never be perfect all the time.</p>
