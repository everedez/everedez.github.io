<h1>Cosmopolitan A Court Of Thorns And Roses</h1>
<p>You’d think that if there is a movie about the doomed romance of two teenage lovers, it would include the rise of the mystical country of Witchland. But no, until now, an undisclosed location in Eastern Europe might be more familiar to those familiar with Doctor Who.</p>
<p>Then, in May 2014, we are introduced to a beautiful but tragic story involving a young woman in Czechoslovakia who leads a courtly life with a few very strange men. (Please note: if you can’t take spoilers too far afield and want to assume that the Czech Republic is not one of the Doctor Who filming location, I’m afraid you’ll have problems.)</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it was the Czech Republic that originally informed its European partners about the project to film here. Czech Minister of Culture and Transport Petr Pavelka (known as Pavelka) said that at some point around the summer of 2005, he had conversations with two Czech friends about setting a story up there.</p>
<p>“The one that interested us were the two boys who were searching for the Doctor. And this was at their mother’s request. They were searching for the Doctor because she needed a drink of water very badly that they were touring the country to conduct a search,” Pavelka said.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the two characters that were used in the film were already characters from the 2009 TV series. G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20</p>
<p>Pavelka added that the reason he later decided to set the film was because he recognized that the two Czech boys were the “children of true believers,” as his Czech colleagues put it “after they traveled for some time in foreign lands.”</p>
<p>Since then, the project has been edited to reflect the film’s strange ties. The novel, titled Libel, was brought to life by the Czech novelist Antonin Mašek when it was set in Prague.</p>
<p>Writing in June 2014, Maek offered a similar description while talking about “the book” – ““[The book] is a love story and intrigue, that seeks out questions about religion, about love … What’s love really all about?</p>
