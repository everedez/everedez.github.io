<h1>Georg Solti Net Worth</h1>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>José Carlos Solti y Francisco Solti are brothers, born on July 14, 1979 in Medellín, Colombia, their names are both Spanish, unlike them. The family has a rich folklore connected with the song and party culture of Colombia, as José Carlos Solti was the brainschild behind the most famous dance craze in Colombia, Fuego, and most likely at least somewhat responsible for music career of Solandrena. José Carlos and Francisco are both famous for their dancing and modeling, in Colombia they ran a company with Parnell Buendía and were hired for commercials and events like this one, Fuego Dancing. In other parts of the world where they have a presence in their country they run a successful fashion chain, Solti (pronounce s-lig-ti)</p>
<p>Soltis use to run a clothing line called Soltirir. they also produce music, like Solti Soul which they are currently promoting on their website through a twitter-like social networking tool, Solti. They are the last male member of the group. Solti and Francisco often go along with each other to show off their dancing skills, but this could be due to them being in a male group. The group became famous in Colombia within the late 90’s, with Solandrena, who sang the well known song “Flores” in Spanish,and Sesi’s (Soltis) voice, probably as the best Colombian voice ever, which led to many males leaving their country and going to Germany, South Africa and other places and Soltin countries to start dancing and singing for the fun of it and lots of drugs. It was already going downhill from there, because their fame became so popular they went to the same town in Colombia where they were raised. If you look closely, you’ll see the graffiti of their father, Solandrena, both images of him are in the middle of different circles, the first one probably where he is on the left side by himself with the last one where they are holding the last ring of the most famous ring in Colombia, Solti.</p>
