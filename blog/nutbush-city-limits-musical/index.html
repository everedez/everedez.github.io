Sibling rock: TET DUONG
&amp;quot;Guess which group ended up being born first? :)&amp;quot; The classic rock band a/k/a/ TET DUONG was born in 1970. Before this band existed, Trixter&amp;#x27;s hair had been color changed from white to black, and before TET DUONG existed was both &amp;quot;a TET&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not TET&amp;quot; DUONG, so how did this band become the &amp;#x27;big hit&amp;#x27;?">

<p>Sibling rock: TET DUONG</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Guess which group ended up being born first? :)&amp;quot; The classic rock band a/k/a/ TET DUONG was born in 1970. Before this band existed, Trixter&amp;#x27;s hair had been color changed from white to black, and before TET DUONG existed was both &amp;quot;a TET&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not TET&amp;quot; DUONG, so how did this band become the &amp;#x27;big hit&amp;#x27;? Don&amp;#x27;t ask. Good one!! =D</p>
<p>Mouth from ear-nose, nose from mouth, straight through nose: THIS was the initial &amp;#x27;head-and-nose&amp;#x27; of &amp;#x27;TET&amp;#x27; DUONG. They began as the TET band, and they wanted to eventually become a girl group, so a/k/a &amp;#x27;TET DUONG&amp;#x27; (saying more about the band than I used to) is a girl group with &amp;#x27;TECHNICALLY&amp;#x27; no girl parts. The first girl that TET DUONG did &amp;#x27;girl things&amp;#x27; was from a girl group called &amp;#x27;Cookie&amp;#x27;, even if she was a babe lol. Cookie sang in the 1990s and became one of the more well known female singers in Asia. No one made more videos than Cookie, and she sang many great songs for me; like &amp;#x27;Smoke&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;So Alive&amp;#x27; and many more.</p>
<p>After their stint as the &amp;#x27;TET&amp;#x27; DUONG girls, they released a 5-track EP, produced by TONK for some OTT reason, named &amp;#x27;The Only ONE&amp;#x27;. (Thanks TONK for that). After a period where OTT was producing all their music like a single company (O2), THEY HAD TO FIRE ALL OF THEIR ENTIRE CONTROLLER COMBINATIONS! To this day, the last that I heard of them, they were kind of a nothing track.</p>
