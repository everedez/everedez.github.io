In case you haven&amp;#x27;t checked in over the past few years, wear your personal power. It&amp;#x27;s part of a growing trend - the wearing of personal power. It can be anything, from hand signals to visual symbols to meditation. According to Janet Lee&amp;#x27;s Story on Wear Power, &amp;quot;A unique ritual carries some serious spiritual meaning to the wearer. For example, the hand movements associated with the wearing of power - the stroking, the kneading or stretching, and the prayer of letting go - and the wearing and use of visual symbolism - the use of a symbol of empowerment, such as a sasquatch, of an astronaut, or of a flower - is an important part of this ritual.">

<p>Wear your power!</p>
<p>In case you haven&amp;#x27;t checked in over the past few years, wear your personal power. It&amp;#x27;s part of a growing trend - the wearing of personal power. It can be anything, from hand signals to visual symbols to meditation. According to Janet Lee&amp;#x27;s Story on Wear Power, &amp;quot;A unique ritual carries some serious spiritual meaning to the wearer. For example, the hand movements associated with the wearing of power - the stroking, the kneading or stretching, and the prayer of letting go - and the wearing and use of visual symbolism - the use of a symbol of empowerment, such as a sasquatch, of an astronaut, or of a flower - is an important part of this ritual.&amp;quot; Some personal power can be hard to resist. If you&amp;#x27;re not ready to let go of the self, it&amp;#x27;s worth taking some action. Wear your power!</p>
<p>Key people who have worn their own personal power include: Sara Bareilles, Jessica Dickinson, Emoji, Elliot Adams, Amy Poehler, Cat Power, Janelle Monae, and the late John Coltrane.</p>

Facing fear<br>
Did you know that many of us face more fear than our therapists ever realize?<br>
</p>
<p>When it comes to real life, it can be hard to face the reality of our fear. In interviews, those facing depression shared how their life did not work out in the way they hoped for. Going to therapy gives us a chance to look at these feelings in a different way - and at least some of the hope that we need to let ourselves feel less ashamed or ashamed by our own feelings.</p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder</p>
<p>According to Dr. Todd Johnson&amp;#x27;s 2016 article, &amp;quot;Attention Deficit Disorder: An Understanding And Medical Reality,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered to be a disorder of the modern times. The disorder is caused by improper functioning of the frontal lobe which is also called the cortex. A frontal lobe disorder can be manifested by: difficulty in following instructions, interrupting or controlling the attention of others and making appropriate decisions and behaviors. This disorder is characterized by deficits of sustained, focused concentration, impulsivity and increased impulsiveness.</p>
