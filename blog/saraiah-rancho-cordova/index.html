<p>Saraiah Ranch is composed of two separate campuses, called Rancho Cordova West and Rancho Cordova East, together making up a two-campus university.</p>
<h2>Rancho Cordova West</h2>
<p>The Rancho Cordova West campus is on the western border of Cordova County but, is situated inland west towards the former Anapamu Cattle Ranch near Fraservilla. The area around the Rancho Cordova West campus is home to a variety of alfalfa, cotton, marijuana and livestock farms just to name a few of the hundred or so that exist here today.</p>
<p>Rancho Cordova West is what the name suggest, but there are no other buildings on the Rancho Cordova West campus. Apart from the government office buildings and the nearby County Court, the campus contains a number of churches: Cordova United Methodist Church, Cordova Presbyterian Church, The United Methodist Church of Calfornia, Grace Baptist Church and the Redfern Presbyterian Church. These are good examples of the varied but not-so-extravagantly historical sides of Cordova County. It does, however, present one of the most scenic aspects to the campus; that being the river surrounding the southwest edge of the campus that carries the San Joaquin river and the river leading to the mountain nearby, though just past the northwest of the campus are the two creeks leading from the west to the east fork.</p>
<p>The campus is basically comprised of a cluster of buildings about 700 yards or so from both the Fresno and the San Joaquin river. These buildings include the offices of the Health and Human Services Department, the Education Department, the Legal Department, a Junior College building, a Center for Contemporary Arts, a post office, a medical clinic, a fire station, a computer center, a library, a prison, a business center, and the home of the Student Government Association; plus student housing and the student recruitment center. One of the buildings housing the Library is where the Library has two different buildings for the Agriculture department and the Research Administration Building. The cafeteria is the same building in which the library has held it&amp;#x27;s functions since it was first built in 1974.</p>
