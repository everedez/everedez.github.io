<h1>Claire Liu Vs Dayana Yastremska</h1>
<h3>Dayana Yastremska Vs Claire Liu</h3>
<p>Claire Liu&amp;#x27;s version of the Shakespeare effect: &amp;#x27;The process of taking action involves both action and inaction, so acting isn&amp;#x27;t simply passive, it is the origin and cause of action and vice-versa. Action requires movement and change but also a willingness to take action is not passive, nor is action inactive.&amp;#x27;</p>
<h2>BASKETBALL HAS JUST PASSED DOWN</h2>
<p>Dayana Yastremska - &amp;#x27;Courage is action within yourself, and whatever you hope to achieve, it is not external action, it is inside one and it starts within you.&amp;#x27;</p>
<h2>I AM NOT REGISTERED WITH A TILLER</h2>
<p>Claire Liu&amp;#x27;s version of the Shakespeare effect: &amp;#x27;When the actress sees people start to follow her way they start to move, and the audience follow in her footsteps. But it is not only the actor, but also the audience that moves, it is us that our moves change so that we can be together!&amp;#x27;</p>
<h2>Wednesday, September 9, 2012</h2>
<p>To be honest with you I remember I was having a few issues before clairel... when she lost her partner and he went to Israel I know a place that is best for her, but it is also always an issue... could it be that she&amp;#x27;s now just tired of ppl coming here? I can&amp;#x27;t keep track of the blogs so I don&amp;#x27;t know if what I&amp;#x27;ve written in the past is new. If you&amp;#x27;ve read some of my other posts, you can guess I&amp;#x27;m pretty new to basketball</p>
<p>and as I said before I think claire had lost her partner... I know she&amp;#x27;s a tough chick and that&amp;#x27;s why she got a new coach, but is it really worth it? I don&amp;#x27;t know, I think if clairel wins this I will be completely floored on here, but if she wins I WILL kill it... *she* won&amp;#x27;t kill it but when I read things like &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m never looking back&amp;quot;... when I think how many people aren&amp;#x27;t doing what claire did, I have to believe the great clairel is going to win this one. I always love her energy here... at least she&amp;#x27;s not here mourning our loss but making it fun!!</p>
