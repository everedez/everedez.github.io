<h1>What Happened To Berleezy</h1>
<p>His name has become synonymous with an almost mythical catchphrase: &amp;quot;BerLeyzy&amp;quot;. First came his personality in the form of a cartoon character he wore on his shirt called &amp;quot;BerLee&amp;quot;, and who became the first celebrity to sign a contract with the NFL. In 2002, Berleezy starred in the comedy film Ice Age: The Meltdown and its sequel. However, despite his brilliant comedic talents, Berleezy&amp;#x27;s image has continued to suffer.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is because most of Berleezy&amp;#x27;s time behind the scenes of the NFL has been spent as a social media manager. In his time as the CEO of Twitter, Berleezy is the most prominent person to have profiled celebrities, famously including Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers and Mark Wahlberg. But even after his hire as the NFL&amp;#x27;s vice president of social media, Berleezy&amp;#x27;s star has remained tarnished. Twitter&amp;#x27;s decline has led to Berleezy&amp;#x27;s infamous use of a hashtag that&amp;#x27;s become the most popular trend in social media these days: #BerleezyFail.</p>
<p>Berleezy used the hashtag as recently as September 9, 2016. On July 26, 2016, Berleezy introduced himself with the following tweet: &amp;quot;Sorry to my haters.&amp;quot; The first thing you might think of when you see this is &amp;quot;what did I do?&amp;quot; But that&amp;#x27;s what had happened in the wake of his #BerLeyzyFail on Twitter: a ton of fun, and a lot of ruffled feathers, from many parts of the media and internet.</p>
<p>Berleezy hasn&amp;#x27;t exactly been the biggest star in Twitter. In this video, he breaks down his role in the aftermath of his involvement with &amp;quot;#BerLeyzyFail&amp;quot;.</p>
<h2>Q&amp;amp;A with Mark Wahlberg and Berleezy</h2>
<p>Berleezy isn&amp;#x27;t the first celebrity to reach Twitter, but for better or worse, he managed to be the most high profile among those he hired a &amp;quot;social media manager&amp;quot;. The best thing about Berleezy, though, is that he helped determine the character&amp;#x27;s back story, and has, as a result, already created some great fan opinion. Last month, Berleezy tweeted a comic GIF of an elderly Trump supporter holding up a pair of glasses, and everyone had to think about it.</p>
