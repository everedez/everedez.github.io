<h1>Chloe Metrose Dad</h1>
<p>We are now able to take a look at our Chloe Dolls in the Art Collection with our MOLDy Digital Scan Gallery.</p>
<p>Chloe Metrose was gifted 5 of our art on the theme of Autumn. I am so pleased that we have one of their Autumn Autumn portraits where Chloe plays with a red spook ball (fun to look at but you could be seriously disturbed if your girls saw that image!).</p>
<p>Here she is with her Angel for Autumn (not featured here) at Craft A World at the beginning of November 2017.</p>
<p>Spring Flowers is still in bloom in Canberra and we are sad Chloe didn’t get any snow in the pictures that she had this Christmas as I have so fond memories of Chloe being at the Mountain View Farmer’s markets here as a kid, she would be all that child would want! What is Spring in Canberra without at least a few pops of colour…</p>
<p>And of course Chloe has a few in our little flower stall in our backyard just in case one day Mum catches her staring out for half a minute at the unaccustomed chill in Canberra air.</p>
<p>And so begins one of our ‘murdes’! These are the three moustaches!</p>
<p>Our first moustache is not all that pretty but Chloe has had it for years thanks to the lovely Bill M for those very first 3 days she spent in Canberra. And in fact in her ‘souvenir’ moustache she says she is related to the scurvy cat! The caption reads:</p>
<p>
“B.L.C – A Melbourne cat.<br>
B.L.C – A Melbourne Cat<br>
Happy Childhood Diaries<br>
</p>
<p>“By default of her father’s job, she was given a very easy beginning. The owner has a smile in her face that would light up any other animal. But this beauty is 6.2 metres or so.</p>
<p>This is how she started life. A kitten who had been kept too long, which caused the owner to get rid of her.</p>
<p>This was a job well done. The owner works in a busy barber shop, just so, a smile, and all that.</p>
