<p>This is the tenth in the &amp;quot;T.L.E.N.E.&amp;quot; series, which came to a boil in 2001 and focuses on the big names in science fiction writing. It has just been reprinted for the first time in over three decades, complete with a book jacket art illustrating the status of the author.</p>

<p>The Library of Tomorrow(by Richard Lindzen, who continues to be one of the premier writers in the genre) takes us to a small house not far from Geneva, where the last great era of science fiction is in full swing. We follow the death of the creator, Isaac Asimov, now in his twilight years, and his best friend, John Ringo, as they depart to the Library of Tomorrow to work on a new science fiction novel.</p>
<p>A Novel About Science(by Richard Lindzen, who was the first in a series of popular science fiction novellas) tells of the formation of the Library of Tomorrow and the novel they plan to write that comes out of the moment when the New York Department of Public Service has an open bidding opportunity for a job within the Library. (Asimov&amp;#x27;s ashes are invited to go with them...</p>
<p>Science in Space(by Richard Lindzen, with science fiction director George Gordon) takes us back to the creation of the Academy of Science, a classic science fiction space opera, and looks at how it reflects the current scientific interests.</p>
