<h1>Natalie Imbruglia Torn Cover Original</h1>
<p>– More than 1000 songs will be recorded, the show will be choreographed and visual effects created with hundreds of assets rendered in VR. The show will continue uninterrupted for a period of approx. 12 hours. Further changes will be made to the show. I will open the show with the speech to celebrate the 25th year of the IFC theater in Toronto. I will deliver a dedication speech and thank you from the front row of the theater.</p>
<p>– A number of social media posts have been created with the intention to celebrate the anniversary. I am honored to be able to be at such a historic event.</p>
<p>– I am not resting on my laurels. I am coming back out there again, I am putting new music, brand of the show on the line, and we are going to do it the new way with the best I have ever seen.</p>
<p>– I will discuss the reasons behind the event and what it means to me personally. I have considered some of the very important factors that have lead to the production to not take place, and ways I am going to continue to push forward.</p>
<p>– Not to forget, a new stage will open up for me in 2022, a 4th stage in 2024, a 5th stage in 2025, a 6th stage in 2026, a 7th stage in 2028, a 8th stage in 2032, as well as many much more exciting things I have in the works for you to see. Just look at my latest post on all the so-called incredible things I have in store. (A year from now I might mention something else :P)</p>
<p>– I am coming back from the upcoming 8th stage on June 11, 2021. At that point we will almost be creating the show and also making new material.</p>
<p>– I’ll be giving a speech and I’ll also have a few slides put together. I’ll also do one video with some action that will include visuals.</p>
<p>– We have a couple of videos for you to see of the actual performance. There will hopefully be still one last video with me opening the show. Stay hungry!</p>
