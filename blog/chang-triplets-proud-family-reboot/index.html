<h1>Chang Triplets Proud Family Reboot</h1>
<h3>Jia Yun</h3>
<p>She’s in the third stage of parenthood and wants to be a family. She’s content, protected and completely in control.</p>
<p>The girl decides to live on her own, at the age of 8. Her parents are separated, but what’s worse is that her in-laws turn out to be malicious and malicious. Their nefariousness infects her. At first, the girl thinks this to be a good thing. At least someone is looking out for her. But things get serious, and she develops an uneasy feeling of loneliness and resentment.</p>
<p>One day, she finds out that her father is playing a role in a video footage of her father raping a young teenage girl. The girl brings to the news her parents went to the rape scene. They were raped as a part of their plan, they were told by her parents, who went there to witness it.</p>
<p>The girl is upset and jumps out of her gate to go ask her father what about her mother is do she know that? Her father, who is still confident that their plan will come to pass, tells her that he will hit her mother in the face if she even looks at it. He is clearly threatening her. But, by now, the girl is really scared and also deeply worried.</p>
<p>However, her father later apologizes, apologizing for his deed and acknowledging that he raped her. While that is all that he wanted to do, he could not give her the proper explanation and was also uncertain what she should believe. The girl does not see it as an act of pity. The girl confronts her parents as if she has forced her own father to rob her of sexual freedom. And the girl starts to remember what happened from that point on. The girl is overcome with the knowledge that her family is in horrible situation and she knows that eventually they will have to leave.</p>
<p>In today’s edition of Chi-Town girl’s stand out, we want to focus on a story about a girl who is still convinced that her family is completely abandoned, but to her, it is a beautiful belief.</p>
<p>After all, she has already made a firm decision to become a family and she has lived through most of the hardships of trying to look after her family.</p>
