<h1>1969 Ford Aurora Ii Country Squire</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>With Ford&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;buck and screw&amp;#x27; philosophy, it really shouldn&amp;#x27;t be a surprise that it would have the supercharger, and many competitors followed suit. These days, superchargers are increasingly common and a good way to power your vehicles without having to replace a block on the block and change the camshaft. However, when they were just a few years ago it was rare and was the extra cost that stopped many people from going for them. So with the latest technology, and a supercharger comes our first look at the entry level F-150 country-squire version. This particular model starts at $6900 and as it only has one previous owner it should be quite reliable and fit for any fleet. We also had a chance to put it through the paces at what we believe, is the absolute lowest price we&amp;#x27;ve ever seen of this sporty engine.</p>
<p>This article was updated 6/15/2012.</p>
<p>The original Auto Trader review was a December 2010 article which discussed the state of superchargers in comparison to what other manufacturers were doing in the area. The article didn&amp;#x27;t talk on how to get good air/fuel ratios with the supercharger, which are not that easy anyways as you can see in the high-damage videos already seen on the website. The following points were left off:</p>
<p>The turbo compressor is actually stronger than before. At stock pressure, 12 lbf of air, that&amp;#x27;s roughly 4 liters. With the supercharger, it&amp;#x27;s up to 10. If you forget that it&amp;#x27;s a supercharger, 3 liters is the absolute minimum, but it&amp;#x27;s more likely that it&amp;#x27;s an air pump, and air pumps usually cost more than the supercharger, that&amp;#x27;s where the extra costs come from.</p>
<p>The 1-bar shock was the weakest part of the intake system and is easily replaced. It was never meant to be replaced but if you need something to be replaced this should be enough. This thing costs almost double the rest of the vehicle! A pair of seat jacks adds that extra relief.</p>
<p>The front valve cover consists of a large cast piece and a small plastic piece that screws to a ring bolt. A small plastic ring was held up above the seat, so when the cast piece broke loose, it slammed down above the seat.</p>
