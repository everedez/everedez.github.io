<h1>Political Correctness Is Fascism Pretending To Be Manners</h1>
<p>Mike Adams, a true liberal, has decided that the entire liberal world needs some sort of institutional and cultural panic: a coordinated scare about what, among other things, we will do about the spread of violence in this country.</p>
<p>Why would the liberal/left deviate from their obviously politically correct-only agenda? By “deviate” Adams seems to be throwing some sort of wordplay. For example, he suggests Obama is a “commie” like Stalin, and he throws out the actual “r-word-s.” His comments do not bother liberals, who simply ignore the bigotry, and dismiss him as an idea man or the idea man’s idea man, only to later admit after he fumbles his language and lets slip, with his victim’s pride, that he has slipped up. But nothing bothers liberals more than the suggestion that Democrats and liberals are on the side of violence against fellow Americans.</p>
<p>It is likely that the idea of violence against America’s citizens is very far more common than liberals and leftists should think. But liberals do not bother to ask what is more likely.</p>
<p>While liberal progressives like to tell us that they are working for human rights, violent threats to America’s citizens are against that very first principle of liberalism: human rights. During the past few months there have been countless examples of conservatives and liberals (often in close proximity) engaged in violence against others. A host of examples are listed below.</p>
<p>Someone throws acid at him:</p>
<p>Liberals go to war on what is described as “the criminals” without any sort of prior investigation and without any fear of repercussions. And even when there is a civil complaint, liberalism just blocks it from being made public. Liberals just think that this gives them a free pass to beat the war criminal.</p>
<p>Liberals claim that they are simply doing “the right thing” and instead of making the soldier afraid enough to go home, they themselves will start to “go home” themselves. (In all fairness, there have not yet been any such assaults by unsupervised young civilians in other wars.)</p>
<p>Someone believes that a Muslim is a terrorist, and that he is therefore the government’s next target.</p>
