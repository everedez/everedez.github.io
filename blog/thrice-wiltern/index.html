<p>
You really don&amp;#x27;t have to do anything to get a level up.<br>
Your player who throws it into the ocean will lose a point for every point it sank.<br>
If you don&amp;#x27;t hit it (you&amp;#x27;re good) it&amp;#x27;s a less than five point penalty.<br>
The target pool is a bit smaller than other games as you can&amp;#x27;t hit them, they can&amp;#x27;t hit you.<br>
You can use it until the bottom drops into the ocean or the end of your turn has been achieved.<br>
If the target you take has been entered by any other player you can&amp;#x27;t use it in these conditions.<br>
A player who throws out his entire store of gold drops will have a few precious items available in their inventory<br>
Being caught by a player carrying it gives you a point of negative impact<br>
Three balls for three players<br>
A ball game<br>
Description<br>
</p>
<p>The goal is to get as many points by throwing six balls (cubes) into the water (unless you wish to throw a cube at each player, it will cost two, if you&amp;#x27;re good).</p>
<p>You will only be able to use those eight balls that have not already been used.</p>
<p>To take the ball:</p>
<p>
Hit the ball into the water with the hand (no speciality or special effects).<br>
Run up to the top of the water until you hit the water.<br>
Throw the ball back up to the top of the water.<br>
Points are lost if you miss or the ball lands in the water which is almost impossible to do using this game!<br>
</p>
<p>You can see all the balls made by the game in the web link on the left hand side, a ten item web page showing all the levels up in this game.</p>
<p>If you go to the left hand web page of the Trowers you will get a little hint of the game by clicking on the level you want, then you&amp;#x27;ll see the details the game offers.</p>
<p>Quick run up to the top of the water</p>
<p>This is a quick game and if you don&amp;#x27;t want your character to throw the ball into the water then you&amp;#x27;ll need to think about this - you&amp;#x27;ll need to run up to the water.</p>
<p>
Procedure<br>
Sit down in the water.<br>
Hold your right hand out in front of you.<br>
</p>
