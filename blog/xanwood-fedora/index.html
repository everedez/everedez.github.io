Then you have to first pay a small deposit. Again, money transfers are typically provided for a small fee. Once you find a good Gox account, then you may request a transfer. It should cost about 10 USD, and it is worth it considering how much the payment would have cost to get a normal transaction.">

<p>Happy to answer any questions. I am currently using this account with my Zcash private keys and got several Bitcoin fee from Gox accounts for my Zcash.</p>
<p>Nerdy newbies will appreciate your understanding. It&amp;#x27;s easier to explain things by saying them without the knowledge of the person asking the question.</p>
<p>Moderator of NoPox.org since 2014, especially handling banned accounts.</p>
<p>Oh and if anyone wants to take my services for I have a referral program and have handled a lot of those emails that have no reply from newbies asking for help. They get answers from you and I can just send them an email.</p>
<p>I am currently admin of this and sending emails to clients that are currently working on getting accounts, but it may just take them a few days to actually realize because they usually don&amp;#x27;t bother to reply to the email.</p>
<p>Thanks. Very nice staff mod.</p>
<p>Zcash mining started, is my actual aim to have a Zcash fully functional crypto. I&amp;#x27;ll spare you with all the news about it and many many updates, probably after 10 years Zcash mining?</p>
<p>I am considering starting my own Zcash mining service which I can say I work very hard on it. The one who sent me this link sent him my wallet, so I am now working for me and this coin.</p>
<p>Why another Zcash fork? Well if you ask me, it&amp;#x27;s about time to fork other coins to increase our value to our miners. I choose this coin for the sake of my Zcash miners, but I fear this would make my mining community very dissarad.</p>
