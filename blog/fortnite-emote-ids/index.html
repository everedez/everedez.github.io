<h1>Fortnite Emote Ids</h1>
<h3>Loot Shop</h3>
<p>I really dislike Dredge&amp;#x27;s store, and the fact that he had the audacity to say &amp;quot;don&amp;#x27;t buy the rocket&amp;quot;, and the fact that there was a rocket with nothing left inside. There are lots of other shops that I can compare, as it is likely that I will never do such a thing (not to mention the fact that people will stop buying clothes once I say &amp;quot;dredge&amp;#x27;s store&amp;quot; haha).</p>
<p>I did not realize that people actually care about what I can/can&amp;#x27;t afford, and what can we buy this year. Now I know the difference between the prices that are available at Dredge&amp;#x27;s and Woot (Woot&amp;#x27;s stores are far more expensive, and, when I shop at Woot, the items in store are more expensive, but the prices in the shop are still better).</p>
<p>How much can we buy this year?</p>
<p>I know the stores that people liked when I stopped in, but do keep track of the prices, and see if there are differences? A friend gave me a gift certificate to Dredge&amp;#x27;s store, but there were really high prices for T-shirts (I am not expecting to go to the mall for shop time) and I did not want to buy something that I could not afford, and it was extremely tempting not to buy it (a lot of people like stocking stuffers anyway).</p>
<p>
Can you purchase &amp;quot;Outposting&amp;quot; Vouchers from the store?<br>
I think I can purchase any of their vouchers in my name, since I have saved enough money lately.<br>
How are you planning on saving money, and how is your wallet doing?<br>
</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m buying all the things I need from Dredge&amp;#x27;s store, and I&amp;#x27;ve added to my savings this year. I will be buying the best things, since I just realized that I&amp;#x27;m doing pretty well, and I know Woot prices are good too.</p>
<p>Speaking of Woot, do you have anything that you can recommend me?</p>
