<h1>Amanda Sperduti</h1>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>Amanda Sperduti from Ecuador received three awards on honorary basis  by CNN Ching-Con for her writings. 1st award was in 2015 for a documentary to create awareness on Social Disonance. 2nd award was in 2016 for a graphic novel. 3rd award was in 2017 for a short film &amp;quot;Una manería de comprendo lo so!&amp;quot; for her humanitarian work.</p>
<p>She once was a paid employee in IT, then she was dismissed from that post  and  hired at an interview company  in 2013. She was arrested multiple times for disobeying her companies rules and not following their written policy, until her friend paid her a penalty for her disobeying rules..</p>
<p>Amanda was denied visa in 2014 by the U.S. Visa agency for &amp;quot;moral&amp;quot; reasons on the basis that she violated immigration laws by  sharing her opinions on Social Dissonance and  was released in 2014 from prison without probation or any restrictions on her residency. She was allowed to come back to the country which she expressed her desire to move to live in the United Kingdom. She moved back home to Ecuador in 2016, a year after the removal from Ecuador of the American company who&amp;#x27;d hired her. She&amp;#x27;s been in the U.S.  since then, now living in the San Francisco, CA United States with her partner.</p>
<p>Stories, not about the third world dictatorship in Ecuador, but about American capitalism which didn&amp;#x27;t allow for social and cultural diversity in US and how America refused to see her other half and left her behind.</p>
