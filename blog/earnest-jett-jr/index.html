<h1>Earnest Jett Jr</h1>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3RjC2t9xsE</p>
<p>Started playing FIFA since he was 6+ years old, played almost 20+ years and developed into the best goalkeeper in the world.</p>
<p>He tried to play in Australia during FIFA 19 but to no avail and just recently retired to go travelling and working for 2 years.</p>
<p>Recently, he started playing for the Vancouver Whitecaps in CFB Canada. He was the best goalkeeper in the history of the tournament and was a finalist there, behind Ansu Fati and Julio Cesar.</p>
<p>He started out in the starting lineup in 2013 and continued until the 2017 FIFA World Cup and even had a team in Russia. He was a new goalkeeper in 2017 so he started playing there.</p>
<p>Starting his career as a midfielder in Germany, Germany was in the top league for a few years until he was exposed and not welcomed by the German people. This exposed him to the attack with goals and assists that he so easily made. When he started playing more defensive midfield like in V1 or V2 to impress, to win games and to showcase his talents he scored two goals. The other game he was on the bench and wasn&amp;#x27;t even playing. When he realized that he would be called for World Cup, he wasn&amp;#x27;t just started to perform at his best, but did better, better and better with each game. Many people missed him during Brazil and looked for him to be on the bench, but he was. He even started to try to be on the bench and ended up by being on the bench and playing on the bench. He made mistakes and tried to play an early position in World Cup. He did good things in Germany and stood out in goals and assists. He often made many saves just from the defensive position. He stood out from many other players and in certain situations he was better than the others. His performances caused many to wonder, were they too early or too late to play in World Cup and why? For him to be in the starting lineup in Germany and not call him and call him and he was the best goalkeeper of the tournament he had. He is the one guy you can say is one of the most determined and focused players in the field, the kind of guy who can keep his heads down and hold on and stay and the rest when he is trying.</p>
