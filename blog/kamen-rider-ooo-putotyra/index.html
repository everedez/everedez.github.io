KAMEN RIDER&amp;#x27;S POV<br>
Please wait as my translator reads everything you have written.<br>
In the middle of the night, my Master appeared in an unusual location in the mountains.<br>
“Masters”, I thought and shivered at the absurdity of the situation.<br>
</p>
<p>He walked up to me and smacked me on the back as he gave me a very strange name, which became clear when ‘Kamen Rider Ooo’ suddenly came to life before my eyes.</p>
<p>
Kamen Rider Ooo<br>
In his mind, the Master said,<br>
“Kamen Rider Ooo!”<br>
Then ‘Kamen Rider Ooo’ turned a blackish, stitched ghost form that you’ll recognize very easily.<br>
“Kamen Rider Ooo is …”<br>
</p>
<p>… out of the blue, he said, for the first time, “The one who was… I fought in the past, the Kensei’s son who drowned in the ocean, who was only an ordinary boy, maybe…” He stared at me with pity in his eyes. He pantomimed how he saved me, how he helped me to survive the ocean, while I didn’t know how he is like in the afterlife, before they all died.</p>
<p>
“Whatever he was, his life was my life. Now that’s all that matters.”<br>
I decided to answer him honestly and returned my Master’s name.<br>
“I-I …”<br>
-I saved you?<br>
-Yes, I am the one who saved you.<br>
</p>
<p>“What is your name? I call you ‘Kamen Rider Ooo’. And I ask a question: what was this Master holding you in your dark grave before?”</p>
<p>I asked him to tell me and he did just that with ‘Arigato!’</p>
<p>What is your name? I ask you, you say ‘Kamen Rider Ooo’. I ask a question. Who was that Master who you saved? ‘Yes.’ You say ‘Kamen Rider Ooo’.</p>
