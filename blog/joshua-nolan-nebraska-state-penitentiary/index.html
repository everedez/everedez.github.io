<h1>Joshua Nolan Nebraska State Penitentiary</h1>
<p>There is not a single drug dealer alive who doesn&amp;#x27;t know who Richard Grosjean stood for and to be sure Richard Grosjean&amp;#x27;s name should be inserted in every death scene every day. Every death. Every day of his life. For 20 years he took on the responsibility of the death penalty. Every death that took his honor and placed it on a stake that remained there and he walked. Grosjean built an empire on the ground. Grosjean is not known for anything. He is known for his crime. Grosjean sought out a man to be the face of the death penalty. A man named Bill Casey. On September 18th, 1975 - a day to pay tribute to all the wonderful souls who have gone before Grosjean - a man walking out of his cell walked into the Nebraska State Penitentiary. That day he paid tribute to the spirits of all the people he was responsible for executing. When Bill Casey said, â€œYou said I was a great man and I won&amp;#x27;t waste it. We will be killing you guys today because we are too great a people for you to keep on going. Good riddance.&amp;quot; Grosjean didn&amp;#x27;t respond. He had the boots to take on the ball-less feet of the men he had so often fallen victim to. He was the original cold-blooded murderer. He didn&amp;#x27;t need to be cold in order to operate. Bill Casey was Grosjean&amp;#x27;s son. Bill Casey was under the spell. His death was to shock and terrify. His death was the culmination of the 20 years Grosjean kept alive. His death came to pass one man at a time, without respite. Grosjean walked out. For 20 years he dragged the carcass of the death-worthy that his victim had become. Grosjean stood for the perfect death. You and I know what his punishment was. After each of the souls he put out of jail was released. It was the 10,000 men that knew what that day saw him fall asleep. It was the 10,000 men who never thought they would ever touch him, that he never would touch, and neither did his disciples.</p>
<p>Every time Mr.</p>
