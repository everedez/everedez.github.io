<h1>Zach Edey Margot Robbie</h1>
<h3>Orcas:</h3>
<p>Howdy, I&amp;#x27;m Zach Edey and I&amp;#x27;ve been with Adventure Time. I was on Lost and a couple other things. I&amp;#x27;m a big video game nerd and I enjoy almost anything to do with comic books, movies and to the point I just generally like things. I love wrestling too but I didn&amp;#x27;t do a very good job of my job at that show last night.</p>
<p>I mean, I won.</p>
<p>Where is that part of me not going on? For anyone looking for awesome show notes check out the preview at oneofthethebest.net/P3P-Reviews-2009-07-13.</p>
<p>That being said, I thought we were in a place here we had to record a show again. So, as we do with all our shows, we&amp;#x27;ve gathered up our regulars and now we&amp;#x27;re going to have some super nice guest spots. So, Zach has kindly asked me to take you down on a virtual bike trip from Chicago! We&amp;#x27;ll see you down there!</p>
<p>That being said, I might not live for a week or so - I&amp;#x27;m currently finishing up a part in a new TV series that I&amp;#x27;m planning on acting in! It doesn&amp;#x27;t start filming until June but it&amp;#x27;s an amazing show with a lot of potential. Plus, after spending three weeks in Chicago with my company on Lost the next six weeks is a completely different ball game - what I&amp;#x27;ve been able to do there was incredible and something I&amp;#x27;d like to get back to.</p>
<p>So, Zach, I&amp;#x27;m bringing you on a fun ride to Chicago.</p>
<h2>About This Show:</h2>
<p>Recently, due to the release of the newest comic book by John W. Smith, a subpar (for the most part) CW pilot called Green Lantern has been picked up. A show called &amp;quot;Orcas&amp;quot; will take place in the New Orleans underworld of the city. The show will be set in a series of flashbacks to the many events that took place there. Season 2 has already begun. This first part will take place months before the show even starts.</p>
<p>The show revolves around a police investigation into the unsolved disappearance of a man from the Crescent City for over a year.</p>
