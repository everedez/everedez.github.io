<h1>Rach Reese Arrested</h1>
<p>The internet is awash in outrage and outrage and outrage and outrage and outrage.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m calling to a national day of action! If I can be so bold, then let this one day be big enough to right a huge wrong I discovered against a former officer in the USA and his defense attorney! Arrest innocent father of four.</p>
<p>I have been trying to find info on the arrest of this young man, who wrote this letter to the FBI. Any info will be useful, as we will be launching a global campaign of love and support for young Rach Reese. He is a hero, too many people continue to make this same mistake. Please share this information!</p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Rach Reese<br>
PSI (Father of four)<br>
</p>
<p>Father of Rach Reese is now in a cell in Florida under arrest! He is no longer on the streets of Atlanta, but in a holding cell in the Gainesville jail! You can read about Rach and his father Rach Reese and his arrest here:</p>
<p>A Father of 4</p>
<p>This is a letter to the FBI, local police officers, and prosecutors.</p>
<p>I am Rach Reese, a young father of four of my own in the United States of America. I now have the heart to let the FBI know that I am a citizen of the United States and am a father of four, three of whom are my own. I am also the father of Rach Reese who wrote this letter to the FBI. I have the strong likelihood of having to appear in front of a judge and jury later, which means you will surely write me back and tell me that you know my true location and that I is not being stopped. Your ability to do so must be in jeopardy. Otherwise, I will stand for my rights and get even for the outrageous ways that you police and prosecute people without regard to the US Constitution.</p>
<p>What I am writing to the FBI is a public plea for help in prosecuting Mr. Reese in the federal and Georgia state courts, which I believe are sovereign, state entities that have powers and rights above the US Constitution. However, I am not afraid of the US Constitution. I love the US Constitution.</p>
