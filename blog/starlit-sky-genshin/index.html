It was the last stand of the Genshin Revan, and he knew they’d all die before they were able to destroy the SDF. He had to keep them alive and do his best to break the trap they were falling into. The Revan knew the game had changed when he’d been captured, but he couldn’t put it into words. He had to trust that his family wouldn’t take him down in that situation.">

Sorcerous or Not?<br>

<p>It was the last stand of the Genshin Revan, and he knew they’d all die before they were able to destroy the SDF. He had to keep them alive and do his best to break the trap they were falling into. The Revan knew the game had changed when he’d been captured, but he couldn’t put it into words. He had to trust that his family wouldn’t take him down in that situation. Every other time he did this, they would kill him. The Revan knew that he must keep that from happening again. After he was unable to communicate with them on the battlefield, they were more than willing to kill him. Maybe it was because he was now starting to get rusty.</p>
<p>I was born in the 21st century, and was a student at an academy for gifted youth. It was only a short distance to an old temple on the outskirts of Eureka City, close enough to be able to see both the Black Light before it zoned the entire place and the Dark Reaches.</p>
<p>The Dark Reaches are a parasitic organism that did not only attack the Church, they were also a child of time itself and constantly killed any of our world’s version that would live into their times. The Revan knew that when he died, his dead body would also destroy the Dark Reaches. They’d slowly adjust the way he died, which would cause the Edicts to be used over several thousand years. During this time, his body would be decaying slowly. It never really seemed to matter, it just continued to do what it was instructed to do.</p>
<p>The only thing the Revan felt to be happy about was that his family would have a new beginning, and that he could finally die at the hands of the Church.</p>
<p>This particular realm of the Church may not be as large as the others he would fight, but it is similar. The Dark Reaches appear nearly always in white outfits. They are as thin as paper, with their bodies made of just a single strand of electric energy. Their clothing reflects the life that they were before in the Church. They sit in their own cages and occasionally hack away at one of the Church’s walls.</p>
