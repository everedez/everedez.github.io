<h1>Alchemy Artisan Decks</h1>
<p>As an Airfare EZ-Pass member, you can earn discounts by flying using an individual airport in any US state without having a reservation. As Airfairer, you also earn additional travel companionship and a portion of purchase.</p>
<p>If you use an EZ-Pass only, the fee is the standard EZ-Pass fare plus only if you reserve your business class ticket at the time of the purchase. For this service, flights won’t be subject to cancellation during your booking.</p>
<p>You can also book at a two-step process: Choose from six pre-purchased pre-booking options and click “Buy Now” to pre-book for a fee of $25 to $100 annually.</p>
<p>If you’re in the US and flying Airfare Explorer, the Premium Extra fare is oversubscribed at $50 a week for passengers travelling outside of US territories.</p>
<h2>Carrier Fees</h2>
<p>Ferry fees</p>
<p>Take advantage of the frequent flyer miles you earn because your loyalty points are credited to your Airfare Explorer account during your next trip.</p>
<p>Every visit to the US is accompanied by a welcome gift to help you remain connected and stay as active as possible. There’s an annual service fee of $3.95 for ferry travel.</p>
<p>If you travel frequently enough, Airfare Explorer can help you build your trip by entering your points into miles.com. Your destination in the continental US, Hawaii, and Alaska can easily be found under “Airport” in the My Services window of the Airfare Explorer application. When you see your points are included in your current trip, simply transfer those points into miles.com account so that they’ll work automatically through miles.com (during your subsequent trip).</p>
<p>Airfare Explorer can help you add up to six months of miles and transfer any new miles with another pass. Since miles.com is a transfer service, you’ll need to first request a transfer and then apply for the new one (via the My Services window).</p>
<p>You can use Airfare Explorer service to transfer miles for your flight or for multiple travel seasons before the end of your current itinerary (with the amount of the transfer or change set manually in miles.com).</p>
<p>As Airfairer, you earn miles as you fly across the US.</p>
