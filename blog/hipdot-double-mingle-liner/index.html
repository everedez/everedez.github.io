<p>In a well oiled brickhouse in the London Town Hall is a huge brass collection of Nazi medals, medals and trophies, displayed in their true form as family heirlooms: small, black-and-gold discs, almost a foot wide, on chains. The collection started three years ago and is the UK’s largest single-owner private museum of Hitler’s Nazi medals, medals and trophies, and is housed in an antiques specialist store in the centre of Soho. The display is the most complete surviving collection of these items in the world, in nine rooms built into the building, and includes more than 110,000 items. The museum includes original full-scale models of many of the medals and trophies that would make Britain and its empire the third-largest trading nation on Earth. Other works on display include: a World War II exhibition in which the British Museum’s first exhibition of the collection was held, and a room fitted out with models of some of Hitler’s personal items during his lifetime.*</p>
