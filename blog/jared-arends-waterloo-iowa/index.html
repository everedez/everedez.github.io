<h1>Jared Arends Waterloo Iowa</h1>
<p>I am very new to having my hair stylists refer to hair at my wedding as &amp;quot;daiten&amp;quot;, but after a few conversations, I have pretty much figured out what this actually means. We have a lot of hair and my hair stylist (well, my husband&amp;#x27;s hair stylist) has referred to my hair and my hair piece (which is not even a piece) as daiten.</p>
<p>
Jared is from Waterloo Iowa. And I&amp;#x27;m not the only person from Waterloo Iowa who has wondered this.<br>
Here are a few things I know but I am excited to find out...<br>
Daiten...oh the lovely lovely piece I am blessed with!<br>
</p>
<p>It is hard to describe...the texture and that color. Not sure if the dye on the ends is for a touch up and the bottom is already a cool tone and gets a deeper shade. My hair and my hair piece got all the dye...the rest of my hair stays the same from when I was younger and that changes colors every few months...it is not really a question of color. It is more of a question what the diteness is.</p>
<p>Everything will be very natural. It is totally changeable if I want it. My brother in law is wearing it. I have been wearing it my whole life but only from a pin in. I enjoy wearing it just for who I am and completely love who I am.</p>
<p>I am a fan of it to any occasion. It&amp;#x27;s just fun!</p>
<p>I am getting married September 18th and I will be taking pictures of it before and will post my wedding pics soon.</p>
<p>I think it is the best idea...I love how it enhances the hair and is very flattering to the figure. Plus, it is super easy when you are out from the shireo, to change it up.</p>
<p>See, they made me think about all the lovely highlights and very lightweight curls that I love.</p>
<p>And it is just too simple when you are on the road and on the shireo not to have something that can grow out and have a nice, dense texture. We rarely get that because of our lifestyle here, but, very often, we will have some work-in-progress. So we just stay with one thing. And that is the daiten for our wedding.</p>
