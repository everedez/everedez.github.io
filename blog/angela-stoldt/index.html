<h1>Angela Stoldt</h1>
<p>A search warrant case has been secured at the home of Laura Verzilliis, who was at the centre of the leaked investigation – and was rewarded for it recently.</p>
<p>Laura Verzilliis has moved between The Netherlands and Portugal since being questioned by the UK authorities</p>
<p>The warrant was used to enter her home last December, where the 25-year-old, who worked as a cleaner in the town of Kortrijk in the Netherlands, was interviewed. She was subsequently questioned again last Thursday, and more extensively, in a search warrant application obtained by the Guardian from the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>The warrant reveals that Verzilliis was interrogated in October 2015. The following summer, she was brought to London, on police advice, to question about an article they had run concerning her work in the Netherlands. There she was questioned in two interviews about a potential sexual relationship she had a year previously.</p>
<p>The police interviewed Verzilliis a second time in September last year. She was questioned about an alleged “incident” with a “young tourist” after she was out with a group of friends.</p>
<p>Verzilliis was then placed under investigation. In her statement to the Ministry, she said she was asked if she would talk because she was “concerned” and felt “consequential”. She said she willingly agreed. She was interviewed again on 14 January this year.</p>
<p>The Ministry said this was the first time it took up the matter, although the information had been submitted to police for a long time already.</p>
<p>The allegations concern one of the many sites the paper said it had uncovered that appeared to have been turned over to the police by Operation Ripcord, an investigation into the theft of government email and data from a group of parliamentarians.</p>
<p>A former Labour MP, Oona King, and others were questioned by the police in 2015 after it was revealed the Department for Business&amp;#x27;s email and data were stolen.</p>
<p>Blairites or naive?</p>
<p>Verzilliis and her friend are firmly at the heart of the sensational back story in Britain - and a central figure in British policing. She was only one of around 50,000 who were sacked. Her alleged crime?</p>
