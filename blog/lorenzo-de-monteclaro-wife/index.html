<h1>Lorenzo De Monteclaro Wife</h1>
<p>Lorenzo De Monteclaro, the Italian actor and singer-songwriter best known as Styx member Jonny Quinn, was born in Milan, Italy in 1964, the son of Mario De Monteclaro and Anselm De Monteclaro. De Monteclaro grew up in the Italian capital, where he attended the St. Agnes School. The highpoint of his childhood (he would frequently play the accordion and guitar) was his visit with his mother and sisters on her annual visit to the seaside town of Portofino, the only family he had left in the city.</p>
<p>After moving to the United States, De Monteclaro’s career as a musician took off — but he wasn’t particularly bright in school, and by high school, he had dropped out to go to music school, earning him the nickname “Mr. Music”. De Monteclaro studied music in his spare time, taking correspondence courses at York University and Buffalo State College. However, he wasn’t drawn to any academic pursuits, and was left figuring things out as his own accordion playing moved him from gig to gig. Meanwhile, he started composing songs that he would later record when not onstage, at his first all-girl punk band, the Fillette Brothers.</p>
<p>It was at his first gig as Jonny Quinn — performing as “Stickman” in a male-only band called “The Desperados” — that he first hit the scene onstage and landed a spot in the mid-1990s with the acclaimed rock group Styx. De Monteclaro was later the guitarist and keyboardist on the band, and during his time with the band, he left the stage to sit in with the band on stage for live performances, initially to avoid hitting the same pitfalls as his old bandmate, Mick Fleetwood, on the hit-making Styx’s 1986 “When in Rome” single.</p>
<p>Although De Monteclaro wasn’t in the same zone as Styx’s older vocalist and songwriter Nigel Oliva, he managed to establish himself as one of the group’s longtime mainstays, filling in for Oliva on many live shows.</p>
