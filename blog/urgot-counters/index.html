<h1>Urgot Counters</h1>
<p>This is a short guide on how to counteract the aggro mechanic of Gobble? In this post I will be going over what to do when facing against an aggro style, to hopefully prevent my team from being killed!</p>
<p>Going Against Gobble! (or mob farming)</p>
<p>Gobble may have seemed overpowered to you. I imagine you could probably improve on this in terms of its effectiveness as well as it is in terms of value. To do this without any drastic changes, I‘ll outline what I felt needed to be done to keep the aggro itself relatively safe at the lowest possible level.</p>
<p>Gobble, at first glance seems like the combination of 2 mobs that are most difficult to escape. However, Gobble is not as easily overcome. In fact, using an open and vulnerable position (one which can also be quickly taken out by an enemy, as shown in this example) is perhaps the most dangerous move one can make of Gobble. Gobble has this awkward overlap in its range. One team can easily remove it as they will likely be attacking another by a certain period of time. Another team can swoop in to attack and take the other mob down off the top of the screen. When this happens, the third mob may be consumed in fire.</p>
<p>Gobble also has a pattern, which I’ve used here to illustrate it. In this case, it looks like we have 3 mobs moving, all of which have a flat attack range of 100-150m. Based on the last and last damage output, the aggro of the mob will increase as the green numbers decrease. When Gobble only hits one of the mobs as well as the second mob in the range of 100-150m, we get 4 mobs of 50 damage each. That’s 34/50 damage. It looks like that’s a LOT of damage to chew on this amount of time, considering the mobs are around 800m apart. So as the first mobs move away, we should also have noticed that some other mobs are taking time to come after. We know that the aggro will increase as more and more mobs come.</p>
<p>Attacking the other two mobs was roughly 4-6 mobs attacking, since they’re moving at around 800m. In effect they are attacking at the same time as the two first mobs.</p>
