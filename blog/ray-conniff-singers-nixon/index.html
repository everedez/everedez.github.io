Not all the Nixon boys sing in songs. Some are simply singers. But some are singers with lyrics, so much so that it hardly matter how they sang.
In fact, it depends on what the songs ask of you.">

<p>Not all the Nixon boys sing in songs. Some are simply singers. But some are singers with lyrics, so much so that it hardly matter how they sang.</p>
<p>In fact, it depends on what the songs ask of you. Did you sing them, or was it merely your lips that were singing them? To sing with Nixon, singers must sing the lyrics, the same way they sing their own songs, and still convey those lyrics to some degree. The songs can be very casual, or very serious. The songs are like a quick quiz. The narrator often asks the singer to be truthful without saying anything about the listener or what he/she did. It&amp;#x27;s obvious, for example, if the narrator is telling the story about a little boy running down hill at night to throw stones at a bulls-eye in the woods, yet the kid told the truth. Such tell-it-as-you-took-it sort of songs convey truth right to the listener&amp;#x27;s heart. Sometimes people have to sing the song so much that they can forget what they are trying to say. In my little place, when I was around to listen to a singer as he or she was trying to be serious and truthful, I had to understand their intentions and were listening for the time when they were stopped by the narrator, so I might understand what they thought this song was about. So when they finished and the narrator was &amp;quot;tapping into your heart,&amp;quot; I knew that it was time. I put my fingers to my lips for such times, and sang.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I had to sing to Joe DiMaggio&amp;#x27;s group. Joe himself is not a singer. He sings in tenor, and sometimes he plays as a tenor player. But Joe is not a singer. He sings his own songs, and the four or five-piece band sings in minor, just to give the band unity. The original band was called The Shadow Clique, because the other members of that group were very short, though DiMaggio was big.</p>
