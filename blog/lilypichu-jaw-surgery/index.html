<h1>Lilypichu Jaw Surgery</h1>
<p>Lilypchujaw (phonetics) is a collection of local words from the Lomang language, but especially from the Mga Nagur (nāgi) and Mungit (manjang). The word kwốkọ is also included in the word nga kwan and mga mwan. I attempted to translate this Chinese word into English according to the Collins Dictionary Dictionary. The word can also be referred to as manang kwan or manang mwan. The word usually refers to a bone saw, a sharp or fine hand plane, or a hand plane, both for opening materials.</p>
<p>The vernacular word for a ‘cut,’ in ancient Chinese society, was nĩshĩ, which can be translated as ‘dentist.’ Therefore, the word can also be translated as dental tool or any sharp thing such as blade for sharp knife, saw, or sharp object. At the end of the 1800s, the word may have come from the same origin, the Mgagan people and ‘dentists.’ Lomang was the dialect that this word was connected to. This family belonged to the Mga Nagur people.</p>

<p>I can still remember the first time I read this in my Junior High School. A Chinese student wrote a list of common words with his classmate. I later found out to be the names of the Lomang and Nga Nagur Ngan ethnic groups, which were separated from each other during the long war and divide. It was really fascinating as to what words these peoples created. Even I, a native English speaker, was surprised by the list. Thus, I thought it was because the writer had a good grammar knowledge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was all easy to spot.</p>
