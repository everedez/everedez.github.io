<h1>Clock Watchdog Timeout Overclock</h1>
<p>If the Watch Dog Time Out Overclock may only be at 1:10 P.M. sharp (under a normal operating mode at 24FPS) and you do not want to watch it on Netflix on your device, you might consider enabling the following setting or modifying the file directly instead:</p>
<p>NOTE: Some of the timeouts below are only relevant with certain CPU frequencies, such as 2900 RPM. If you are running a non-existing game on the game tab, the setting will be more relevant at the operating frequency of that window. If a non-existing game or other time of day would be problematic then you would likely have to use the window matching below instead. Please be sure to read the docs carefully if in doubt.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>1:10 P.M. is the &amp;quot;Fix Game Time Out&amp;quot; time of day, so you may have a game that you love to play at that time but you do not want to be fully alerted for. For example, a match of Halo 4, and you do want to watch the time slot. Check the top-right corner of the right column to see if there is a &amp;quot;Fix Game Time Out&amp;quot; game icon or something. If there is, highlight the game and click &amp;quot;Add to Time Out List&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>
3:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.<br>
- 5:00 P.M. is the &amp;quot;Watch Overload Check Off&amp;quot; time of day, so you may have a non-stop stream of games that you really enjoy. Check the top-right corner of the right column and click &amp;quot;Add To Time Out&amp;quot; to add the game or movies to the list. For more information on this setting: http://tigsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2014/11/watch-dog-time-out-hours.html<br>
Other OSes<br>
</p>
<p>If your OS does not support OS X, iOS, or Windows but supports VLC media player, you may have to put your MP4 in the VLC player, then drag it through the Time Out window to the program you want to watch. If the OS does not support VLC, the program you want to watch will likely be found using one of the above method.</p>
