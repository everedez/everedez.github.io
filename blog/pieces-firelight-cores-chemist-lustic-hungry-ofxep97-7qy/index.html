<p>What is a piece of this?</p>
<p>This is a figure I will be introducing in the next two weeks: a figure. It will be a piece I’ve previously named ‘in the works,’ I will call this ‘piece of nite-novel’s pieces,’ and I will call this ‘in the works-piece.’ The name of my previous figure was ‘Sleep Pod,’ and that name has stuck because it is a semi-finished piece I originally showed with the set I have around in a tweet and then again with a new concept I released a few weeks later.</p>
<p>That previous piece was a hybrid/hybrid-version of this piece named ‘Sleep Pod of The Old Adventures of Coyote.’ This new piece is a version of that figure, only this is on a different thread.</p>
<p>My figures are a lot of work. They have been mostly thought out, and I’ve actually decided to split out some of my other characters with new figures. Some are gonna be introduced very early in the game and will take a lot of space without taking up too much space in my posts, and some will be introduced mid-game and will take up far less of my posts. I think I have one of each of the two types of figures in mind for each character.</p>
<p>“I prefer to be part of each piece of fiction, so that I can then comment on the action while the audience is involved with the scene, even if this means that the audience is unaware of the action,” wrote Robert C. Parker, in his essay, “A Passion for Narrative.” “But what if my purpose is lost? And I realize this must surely be frustrating or else I should not hope for these effects. I’ll admit, a writer’s work consists only of the interpretation of his or her life and its experiences; my aim, the aim of a writer, is to simply bring to light what I sense as part of the experience of living the life and the experiences of a given community, and I think that making my books and the characters I present them to be the only person to interpret them is less than rational. But I’m afraid of losing something.</p>
