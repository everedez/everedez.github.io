<h1>Unknown Mortal Orchestra Layla</h1>
<p>Three hundred years ago, long before even Rastros had mastered the dark arts of magic, a noble-family woman named Layla Greyhawk had the misfortune of being taken prisoner by a group of monsters known as the Mortal Orchestra. Sixteen years of ruthless captivity later, Layla managed to make it to a sanctuary deep in the mountains to do battle with them and her abductors—and fell in love with one of them.</p>
<p>After some time, Layla falls gravely ill and dies, entwined in a red mist that forms when an unnatural force draws her down a secret shaft. A champion known as the Princess of the Mist must step forward to take this kingdom back. She will have to convince the powers she left and the one she loved who ruled this land, allowing them to regain their own lost rights.</p>
<p>This title is by FARH. It is due to be released July 19th via Deviant Art. I&amp;#x27;ve created a video for it, and I recommend watching before buying.</p>
<p>This episode follows Layla and her retainers as they lead their citizens out of the mountains to assist in the battle against the Mortal Orchestra. The story also introduces a girl that’s been released by the mortal realm named Justino.</p>
<p>Layla’s retainers are:</p>
<p>Ysa: The Chief General and the General of Guards and the High Executioner of the Court of the Emperor and the First Earl of Lyrandar and the General of a Hundred.</p>
<p>Nel: The Commander of the Cavalry (and the greatest swordsman in all of the realm).</p>
<p>Lady Ulysse: The Head of the Royal Wardrobe.</p>
<p>Tibald: A Knight of the Order of the Southern Islands (as in, to the southward of the southern coast of the first continent and its name)</p>
<p>Deh: A Knight of the Order of the Western Star, named after the vampiric King of the Ghouls.</p>
<p>Lady Markel: A Knight of the Order of the Great Duke of Astabiel, responsible for keeping the royal family secure and honoring their rights as the first Queen of the Realm and the Champion of the Secret Wind.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot more people could be added here, but this was already done.</p>
