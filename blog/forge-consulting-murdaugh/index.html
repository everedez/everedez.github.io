## Part I: GIMPLE EXAMPLE<br>
This is an exercise I taught when I was in high school. For the<br>
last three years students have been using it in our class and I<br>
believe it is the best of the exercise files. I have made quite<br>
a few improvements since then. Since last year, the HTML and XHTML<br>
sources have been incorporated into the source code<br>
of the file. I have changed the &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; elements and<br>
&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; elements to &amp;quot;use CSS&amp;quot;. The image of a hamburger with<br>
as many side-slices as you can fit has also been changed. The<br>
default behavior of the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element has been changed. Instead<br>
of just setting the padding/margin around the image, you now have<br>
two properties. The top/left property is to the left and the<br>
vertical/horizontal property is to the bottom and<br>
right. For my examples I used the word &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot; as the side-<br>
slices. Just write the text at a slight distance off the page. For<br>
me it is much clearer this way. I have also altered the fonts, but<br>
it was just a matter of making sure that the &amp;quot;Orange Gothic&amp;quot;<br>
font that I wanted could be used (inside the &amp;quot;r&amp;quot; part of<br>
&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;gold&amp;quot;&amp;gt;orange&amp;lt;/font color&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). Also, I have<br>
changed from right-to-left (in this example) to left-to-right<br>
(in the default example). Just making sure that the code is correct<br>
did the trick. So that&amp;#x27;s what I have done. The other things that<br>
need an explanation are for the form and the edit menus. Again, I<br>
need the form. Some of you are too smart to use a traditional format.<br>
You can just put &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;&amp;gt; text-fields in with<br>
the button.<br>
