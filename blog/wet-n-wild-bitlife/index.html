Kelp: Life in the open oceans is a hostile place, with constant wave driven erosion and corraling by currents that sustain fish, crustaceans, and marine vegetation. The vast majority of the world’s oceans are too cold for living organisms to survive, and many are too salty to support life forms.
Living organisms in the ocean compete for space and nutrients, and few species can utilize every conceivable habitat found in the ocean, either for growth or species conservation.">

<h1>Wet N Wild Bitlife</h1>

<h2>Kelp:</h2>
<p>Life in the open oceans is a hostile place, with constant wave driven erosion and corraling by currents that sustain fish, crustaceans, and marine vegetation. The vast majority of the world’s oceans are too cold for living organisms to survive, and many are too salty to support life forms.</p>
<p>Living organisms in the ocean compete for space and nutrients, and few species can utilize every conceivable habitat found in the ocean, either for growth or species conservation.</p>
<p>The ocean ecosystem offers no safety for the more vulnerable species. Instead, many forms of life act out of desperation to gain resources needed to live in the open ocean. The ecosystem is rife with ecological catastrophes, producing massive sea level rises, coral reef bleaching events, and ongoing ocean acidification.</p>
<p>The great ocean habitat and biodiversity for ocean species has been limited by habitat restrictions and by climate. The introduction of man-made (natural) habitat helps to restore biodiversity, as well as support ocean ecosystem health.</p>
<p>A new book is being launched in 2020 to address the overabundance of fish in the oceans: WIPO-sanctioned book about fish biomass, sustainability, and human-induced habitat loss. Our goal is to help to provide a scientific understanding of how fish and other marine life are thriving, from habitats discovered by scientists, to habitats discovered by the public.</p>
