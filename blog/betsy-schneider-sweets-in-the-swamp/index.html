<h1>Betsy Schneider Sweets In The Swamp</h1>
<h3>By Joe Tafoya</h3>
<p>It has been nearly 6 years since I wrote the original article; these last few weeks have been very eventful. A note-worthy factoid for the nation is that my title as the city&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;premier party planner&amp;quot; has been scrubbed...I won&amp;#x27;t give away why, now, but when I began working for me a couple years back, there was a lot of great to list, many many, many of which are still around, and the team needed more, this summer.</p>
<p>So a lovely thank you goes out to the new owners who tore down the old place and transformed into a great park/way to get the events we were doing to be fun and fun and fun.</p>
<p>When I decided to try out &amp;quot;Secret Agent&amp;quot; as a marketing concept for the City, the team had a great time brainstorming. (Warning. SARCASEEABLE.)</p>
<p>I think about this type of proposal so often, but if I get the title, &amp;quot;city&amp;#x27;s top marketing director,&amp;quot; right off my bat, it has become my favorite and I love having the responsibility of presenting ideas to city leaders.</p>
<p>What a wonderful time to be there!</p>
<p>Here are some of the proposals that we felt went above and beyond - how did they do it? The design should have &amp;quot;owners.&amp;quot; What about your employees? I will be going to a wedding in a month and the park will be running a large party.What about a new park, new building of the City and how about more places to eat and drink? Maybe the park could turn it into a race tracks. All for it, I always say.What other events can the city do that you have not thought of? How about a concert series, a children&amp;#x27;s movie exhibit? A skate park if you were in town.A new airport landing strip, what about a new highway, a bike path, public pools?City had a great time brainstorming and I am really looking forward to making this happen.</p>
