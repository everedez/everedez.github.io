Anyway, to close this section out I have decided to drop all information I got from Goblins from previous threads.<br>
I&amp;#x27;m gonna do a rough conversion here, right off of what I know of Goblins.<br>
</p>
<p>Some people think Goblins are better than they were in the past because they lost part of the lore due to the &amp;#x27;thief wars&amp;#x27; and stuff like that, but I don&amp;#x27;t think so. I still think Goblins are top-notch.</p>
<p>To see what I would do I would recomend watching something by ZachyPzGox [http://www.youtube.com/user/AThocracyChillen ] or John Romero [http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZfBL7iFooBXAYe_tQmst-w ]</p>
<p>Goblin might be one of my favorite game modes now but it&amp;#x27;s never gonna be superior in the end to, for example, Hex or Hex Flipping.</p>
<p>To understand my point about Goblin, I think the current version of Goblin is generally solid. But they have some strong ideas in place for where they want to go, and I think they&amp;#x27;re trying hard to give us a better roleplaying experience. I can tell it&amp;#x27;s happening because they released A Realm Reborn: Ascension, which is a fine game. It has some great ideas, and it&amp;#x27;s a pretty good roleplaying engine. I believe their future games will be excellent.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s not that Goblin is going to fail these days, it&amp;#x27;s just that the way things are currently set up is not necessarily what we want for the future of Goblin.</p>
