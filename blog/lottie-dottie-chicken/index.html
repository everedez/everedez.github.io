<h1>Lottie Dottie Chicken</h1>
<h3>Chickens</h3>
<p>Unbelievable fried bird, this is the real deal. Serve them as a side dish over hot rice or rice cooker, they make for a great family meal. They freeze well too.</p>
<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p>Remove thighs from the chicken pieces, depending on how thick they are. Take the skin off the breasts. Take the thighs from the chicken. Season with salt. Cut each thigh in two from the middle, leaving the thick middle part of the thigh intact. Cut each cut in half from down the back.</p>
<p>Cut the breasts into pieces each. Season with salt. Cut each piece in half from the middle, leaving the thick middle portion of the breast attached.</p>
<h2>The Sirloin, Leg and Shoulder</h2>
<p>Use 4 pieces of pork for a side. Season each piece with salt.</p>
<p>Cut the sirloin in half. Season each piece with salt. Cut the pieces in half from down the middle by removing the two thick thin tendons from the bone. You will get a lot of blood.</p>
<p>Season each cut in half by removing the two thick thin tendons from the bone. You will get a lot of blood.</p>
<h2>Sear the Sirloin</h2>
<p>Slice the meat off the bone into thin strips, making sure you leave as much meat as possible, there will be a lot of blood. Use some olive oil to cover for cooking, you don’t want the blood over cooking, so try and minimise the fat. Season each piece on both sides with salt.</p>
