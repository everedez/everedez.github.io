<h1>What Is Oh Eff Creator</h1>
<p>Oh Eff Creator is one of the most popular audio players I have ever used. The sounds, loops, dubbing, effects and VSTi plugins have all been incorporated into one well-designed main window-like GUI. They are basically the quickest way to start creating music.</p>
<p>There are, however, a few things that the GUI could do to add more functionality to the player. Currently you get an enormous amount of functionality offered by the standard window alone. The GUI could make it possible to add multiple ways to start and playback the music that is currently playing.</p>
<p>One way to do this would be to open the GUI from and then create a new taskbar menu. Select and open from there, then clicking on the &amp;quot;edit&amp;quot; button should have something with that functionality.</p>
<p>The name says it all. This is the first time I have done anything in the GUI since the first time I began using Oh Eff. I do think that Oh Eff does a good job of drawing the visual identity onto the UI.</p>
<p>The GUI does have a few interesting features. First of all, you have the ability to change the color of some of the icons at any time. Secondly, the GUI appears to change color only when you have the focus on it. I suppose this could be used to display a preview of what you have currently chosen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have been unable to play a song and see that the GUI changed color to blue when I selected the &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; icon. I tried different tunes, but never get a blue color change in the song window with no audio. I do not know if I am doing something wrong, but it is somewhat annoying to see my GUI flashing colors when I play my music with one of the most visually pleasing available software.</p>
<p>Another thing that I have not been able to do is create a version of the GUI that automatically works through the song, and then when finished, moves the song to the playing position. I have been unable to do this, and it breaks the large portion of functionality that the GUI currently provides.</p>
<p>For those users that like to work with the GUI, feel free to comment below. Also feel free to leave me your comments if you notice any significant bugs or issues with the new version of the product.</p>
