Uptime<br>
Up since last week no issues has been reported.<br>
So far, so good, apart from the mysterious, silent crash a week ago, which I can do nothing about....<br>
We are hoping. Still no news though.<br>
Thanks to everybody, for keeping the site updated, and continuing to support (as always) the game.<br>
A few things..<br>
Some things here!<br>
NPCs (nigh on 8K now, and growing)<br>
The game is pretty damn close to 8K (with a slight increase in game speed, and a nice increase in player count).<br>
Players&amp;#x27; stats: Everything has been recorded, so we have decided to post the totals<br>
Final damage (all weapons, grenades and in some rare/special case cases more)<br>
Final damage per player<br>
Final Kill rate<br>
Final Objective rate<br>
Final Objets per player<br>
Teamwork rate<br>
Overall<br>
</p>
<p>And, after a week of rest, it seems like everything is OK (or as OK as it&amp;#x27;ll ever be), barring the occasional crash, and just occasionally a too fast or too slow game... No problems at all.</p>
<p>I have had one really weird bug, which might be resolved after some rest, but it left me uneasy, so I didn&amp;#x27;t actually look at the code.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the game works okay, most of the times.</p>
<p>Still have a few issues to sort out...</p>
<p>But, while the game works, it is an achievement really, and there are no hard feelings while playing this game, or viewing your stats on the other consoles.</p>
<p>Hope that it will all be OK, and yes, after a week of rest, I am happy, and my game is showing nice quality.</p>
