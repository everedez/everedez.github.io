Hays Hawks Elementary School on the way down
This weekend was &amp;#x27;down&amp;#x27; week at Home School Hays Hawks Elementary. Many Hays Hawks students have not been in contact with their families over the holiday break. Many of the parents and teachers left for the holidays were overwhelmed when they got back to their homes. However, we still had a productive time at the school.">

Hays Hawks Elementary School on the way down<br>
</p>
<p>This weekend was &amp;#x27;down&amp;#x27; week at Home School Hays Hawks Elementary. Many Hays Hawks students have not been in contact with their families over the holiday break. Many of the parents and teachers left for the holidays were overwhelmed when they got back to their homes. However, we still had a productive time at the school.</p>
<p>One part of this was collecting last Thursday&amp;#x27;s school supplies for the computers in order to get them back with me by Monday. However, the most important part of the trip was getting a group of older students to attend a movie in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>This school was originally in Hays, Ohio. But a fire in 1877 destroyed most of the school&amp;#x27;s buildings, and Hays School was moved up here in 1879. In 1881 there were five classes. The students were taught by teachers who were from the neighboring schools (Altoids and Western Reserve).</p>
<p>Altoids taught English which they called &amp;quot;Ohio.&amp;quot; Western Reserve taught practical mathematics. Here the math was kept simple and easy for students.</p>
<p>Hays and Altsau were next year classes and all Hays students are enrolled in this school. We have students in the 12th, 9th, and 8th grade. Some of the older students have moved away for college. It is quite emotional to see students move every year so we try to keep these kids together. It is a little sad seeing some kids who are used to being closer to their families move to different schools or schools that didn&amp;#x27;t see them for many years.</p>
<p>Tonight was a boys basketball game! We had to start off with our normal school schedule which ended at 10:30. But it was good to start early because I wanted this class to finish early so they could walk to the corner of the library and get their lunch!</p>
<p>They would find their lunch amongst the cardboard and recyclable food boxes after every class. In our school there is really a bag of paper to eat with each student. However, it is mostly food so there is very little choice on the bag. They also had two exceptions.</p>
<p>In the morning they would change into their uniforms and head to the door.</p>
