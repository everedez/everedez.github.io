<h1>Dark And Darker Cleric How To Use Spells</h1>
<h3>1. Dark and Darker Cleric FAQ Template: General &amp;amp; Spells Description</h3>
<p>The General &amp;amp; Spells section of the quest guide will allow you to begin answering some of the basic questions you will come across on your quest</p>
<p>The lore can be answered if there is enough time</p>
<h2>2. How To Find Mysterious Items</h2>
<p>Walk into an Eerie tavern, bar or shop and look for items with red and silver inscriptions. Anything that indicates that you are a cleric will most likely tell you where you can find the item. Almost any kind of ‘god’ items or the gold that comes with them can also tell you where you can find the items.</p>
<p>
Some items will state where the item is from in a more cryptic language, such as ‘a gold treasure’<br>
Most items will simply state that the item is in a building or a passage that cannot be unlocked by adventurers<br>
3. If an Adventurer Finds A Mine<br>
</p>
<p>For those adventurers who are entirely new to the world map (and its map-makers) we wanted to make sure that you and you group are aware of the map layout and where the map is, so your adventurers do not become totally lost. In this section you will learn how to cross off two items you can pick up during your travels (itinerary) to visit major towns.</p>
<p>Once you have these two items picked up, you can find a large number of minor towns throughout the World Map and even find a place near The Eldritch Abode that you need to visit to get your travel costs correct. The majority of minor towns in this quest will be located in the city of Ashmead. A few of the major towns have locations near the surface of the map, including the mining village of Tol Thneil, The Old Minkville Mine, the Dwarven Realm, Cat’s Foot Gorge, The Temple of Valoric, The Rift Lake and The Dragonstone Mine. Several others will be near other locations in the game like Ashmead and the Mink Mines.</p>
<p>Because these are the major towns and because these are the mine locations that players travel to to find and buy their items, it is more important than ever to study their layout before you head out to these areas so that you get those options correct.</p>
