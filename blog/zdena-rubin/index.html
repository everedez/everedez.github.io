Here, you can get a sneak peek into the classroom that Katarina was born into. From the chalkboard notes on class activities, to the slideshows at the back of the room, the room is connected to the rest of campus with a series of digital touches that link it all together.

<p>The chalkboard notes on class activities and the interactive computer displays are all connected to each other in the classroom that Katarina Adornić lives in. In the hallway, there are some clever touches in the shapes and colors of the posters. It serves as a distraction and a little distraction to read some of the slideshows. In some cases, the files are connected and connected again, and in some, it serves as a way for the students to continue reading during the non-interactive slideshows. It may get a little confusing reading all of the files, and a lot of the time, it does make it easier for the student to keep track of what everyone is doing in class.</p>

<p>The digital displays that are connected to the chalkboard note on class activities are also tied into the online platform to which they are connected. Some of these digital displays were built by Katie Bailey. One of Katarina&amp;#x27;s favorites - The Alphabet Quiz - is connected to the online platform that she shares with the other students. Some of the files are accessed after class. While in class, Katarina often has to use the computer. On the back of the poster, there are instructions that guide Katarina along the way of exploring the online platform of the classroom. On the computer, Katarina can access the laptop and play around with things online for awhile. Then, she turns back to the page and continues her exploration. Katie Bailey is inspiring this special teacher student relationship. She is willing to take the time to continue to help Katarina understand everything she can through the digital platform that she has built.</p>
<p>Another nice digital touch in the classroom is Katarina&amp;#x27;s desk computer. Each class has a computer sitting out and Katarina has only two other students at school - Kari Hoffman and Taylor Schniebler.</p>
