<h1>Makayla Heckman Norris</h1>
<p>Born and raised in St. Louis as part of the Jewish population in the St. Louis Public Library (SLPL), she returned to her hometown in 2015. When she initially decided to leave her job in SLPL, she told her coworkers, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#x27;s break up and make this thing work for me,&amp;quot; but within a day, she was fired by an SLPL employee. Prior to this, she grew up in the world of art and was involved in painting and teaching for several years in high school. For an interview, she discusses her career path and her move between SLPL, St. Louis Community College, and Northern Illinois University.</p>
<p>Makayla started her art career in 1970 when she moved to St. Louis to attend SLPL. Her passion and focus of the painting career, started around the age of 11, has led her to an exciting and vibrant life in that she is an artist, artist of the arts, and supporter of others.</p>
<p>Founded in 1982, SLPL receives over 15,000 annual patrons and over 2,000 students of all ages throughout the year. In 2012, SLPL celebrated its 25th year of service. She currently employs 33 faculty, 16 art staff, and 35 administrative staff. The college currently boasts of over 1,340 full-time undergraduate art students as well as over 300 part-time/undergraduate degree-seeking arts students in concentrations. SLPL also has a College Student Health Center (SSHC) that provides on-campus health care services for its students and faculty members. In the summer months, SLPL offers many other services and programming in conjunction with its art programs including monthly art and language classes led by Masters in Arts degree-seeking students, an annual summer Art and Language Camp series, Art and Life group art retreats, and many other programs.</p>
<p>The School of Painting offered major in painting from the sixth grade through the last three grades of high school. Around the same time, she took one or two courses in drawing. This was followed by art-appreciation class beginning in elementary school that she said was very beneficial.</p>
<p>Makayla has been on display in Museum exhibitions in her native St. Louis, Kansas City, and throughout Michigan, with previous exhibits at the Brunch House in St.</p>
