<p>&amp;quot;All along, I&amp;#x27;ve had my doubts about what I was up to,&amp;quot; DiMaggio says. &amp;quot;I figured I was going to get to be a reserve player. You are to the best one of the best player in your class.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>He then described his ineligibility, the need to reach a certain level and the usual trappings of being an NBA reserve.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;The people sitting in the media meetings -- they couldn&amp;#x27;t believe I couldn&amp;#x27;t make it. They had a bunch of people from other leagues at it,&amp;quot; DiMaggio says.</p>
<p>The media was in attendance on Wednesday at his introductory news conference.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;That night, the No. 1 seed, they never made an arrangement. They had no intention whatsoever of letting me do this,&amp;quot; DiMaggio says.</p>
<p>The selection committee will meet again next Thursday between the Cavs and Lakers, once the NBA season has concluded.</p>
<p>DiMaggio said he would not reveal his vote since the information would be protected while he competes, but added that he had hoped to break in with another big leap.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I never imagined&amp;quot; -- and never expected -- DiMaggio to get to this point, he says. &amp;quot;I never put anything in play that made me think it would happen,&amp;quot; he said.</p>
<p>DiMaggio said: &amp;quot;I thought I had to try. They had to know I would try. I set it up to have a very difficult time with this, something nobody else has to deal with. It&amp;#x27;s not something I wanted to think about. It happened with a pretty unexpected method.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>His mentor Mike Green was an acquaintance of DiMaggio&amp;#x27;s father, who coached John&amp;#x27;s boys at the YMCA school in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. Green coached college during DiMaggio&amp;#x27;s junior college days. DiMaggio was born in Detroit but grew up in Flower Mound, Texas. A longtime friend of coach Bruce Fizdale, a friend of DiMaggio&amp;#x27;s father, is a member of the Lakers&amp;#x27; coaching staff.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, DiMaggio thanked Gail Collins, his Lakers front office contact since his days with Jim Bunning, for her encouragement during his career.</p>
