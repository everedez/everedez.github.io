<h1>Gibson Theodore Tulip</h1>
<h3>The First American Warble Guitar</h3>
<p>I got to hear about the Gibson guitar back in 1980. Having my guitar completely build was extremely difficult, but I did get to sit in with Gibson, had actual conversations, talked about the history of the guitar. I heard that Gibson was in great financial trouble. Of course, the more I thought about those financial troubles, the more I cared. I also talked to Geoff Palmer, and he showed me some things before he died, not the best of the better looking examples available, but nice and neat. Anyway, that&amp;#x27;s how it came about. I wanted to move on, and my girlfriend offered to find a guitar shop in Portland Oregon, where we would move so that I would have a guitar, and then found this place, which was run by the son of a friend, someone who was a top guitar builder. She found a copy of the &amp;quot;Greenwood Batch&amp;quot; that was used in the 50-54 Gibson lineup of Stratocaster and Epiphone guitars, and it had some original cases and was nearly complete.</p>
<p>This was a very obscure guitar. Basically, it was a rare Gibson build. That&amp;#x27;s why its &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; specs were such a rarity. These days, you can&amp;#x27;t even find the case! In a way, it&amp;#x27;s like finding a few originals of a set of vintage Sunburst, a rare period amp or two, some rare tubes etc... All you have left is that gorgeous case with all the original rubber grommets and all. Anyway, the case wasn&amp;#x27;t even listed online, and even though I had it, I didn&amp;#x27;t put anything on it myself. I never thought it was anything special. I figured it had been used once or twice in a factory in New Jersey, so I didn&amp;#x27;t care, but the case - which was way above my price range if you want to know that kind of detail! - had never been seen before. It was just a plain, basic case of one white plastic bezel, two black plastic sides and a rounded looking metal.</p>
<p>It was hard to find. The guitar case was never listed as an &amp;quot;exhibit&amp;quot; so people wouldn&amp;#x27;t have to drive up to the plant and look at the side, and sometimes they wouldn&amp;#x27;t even let me look at it because they were too worried about finding a second case to fill it.</p>
