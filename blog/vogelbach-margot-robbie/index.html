<h1>Vogelbach Margot Robbie</h1>
<p>Newly-minted Tigers coach Justin Leppitsch, a man of considerable self-awareness not only to spare the pompous fools in his side, but a man who enjoyed years of financial backing from the many clubs that offered him the chance to coach, made sure he made no errors in the first interview with the media after his job was secured. Asked about his feelings about playing in such an under-marketed game, he was thoughtfully and matter-of-factly frank and told them he wasn’t going to risk getting booed by the Tigers’ travelling fans, as he did with Gary Stallard in 1978 and Andre Dawson last year, and so would not be phased with a lack of support.</p>
<p>“The most unusual thing about the last place I coach is that we’re so quiet,” he said. “We’re so quiet that we don’t raise fans’ expectations. We just play well. We’re never involved in trying to attract supporters to a game because they think it’s going to be big.</p>
<p>“I was confident coming into this job. I had the backing of my previous clubs, the three clubs that offered me the best opportunity in the city of Cologne – Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, German Cup – and also of a number of TV sports channels. I was told that I had ‘too bad a reputation’ as a coach in Germany. In a way, you see these great teams and see how they’re built through their coaches. I got the highest success rate in coaching against teams who were higher on the domestic ladder. I think the teams just went along at an easier time for them – it’s almost a mutual thing.”</p>
<p>By way of example, if he was asked about his starting XI, there wouldn’t be much fan-favouritism, but he was unequivocal that he’d take Daniel Sturridge as his No.1. Given his past success last season, with the right personnel, it seemed a sensible choice, though it was pleasing that he offered to give his No.12, Daniel Weohy, a start so long after Sturridge’s. “I play a lot with Daniel in training and really respect him,” he said.</p>
