<h1>Jajuan Johnson</h1>
<h3>Lance Cpl. Johnson</h3>
<p>Senior Airman Justin Johnson and Patrol Sergeant Keely Williams will likely face some bumps and bruises on the deployment to Iraq. But regardless of their respective situations, there are significant similarities in the two Marines&amp;#x27; experiences. Every American who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, both in the combat and the non-combat segments, had a variety of physical challenges, the hardships and the challenges they overcame. That is both the normal and the only and singular reasons that 1,000 troops are sent into combat in this environment. Lance Cpl. Johnson and Private Keely Williams, once deployed to Iraq, are soldiers who know the challenges well. Neither had any special skills that helped them survive and adjust to combat. Both have some challenges and difficulties, but the most important one is the right one, which will leave the two men in shape as they face the long grind of serving their nation in the promised land. And that is a weight that no one should ever take lightly.</p>
<h2>Cpl. Johnson: The Ranks</h2>
<p>On February 10th, Justin Johnson was sent to Iraq to service in the Paratroopers Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division (Air Assault), 1st Brigade Combat Team, 50th Infantry Division. Johnson flew the AR-15.50 caliber machine gun on aircraft as a combatant, but after his tour on September 11th he was sent overseas to participate in a tour of duty in the National Guard, 1st Echelon (the 1st Division is based at Fort Hood), for eighteen days. In between tours he served with Air Assault Platoon, Company A, at Tyndall Air Force Station outside Atlanta, GA.</p>
<p>Justin Johnson underwent medical training for his trip to Iraq and completed National Incident Management and Command and Control. His medical training included a search and rescue course, but he was not interested in a search and rescue mission if given the assignment. Other than that, he wasn&amp;#x27;t interested in a raid or training mission. A rifle platoon is a unit that both train and fight. Justin Johnson will be heading up the first phase of a patrol. That is the unit Justin will try to protect. Justin will also be leading a detachment of an infantry support team. This allows him the time to go over the terrain with his men.</p>
