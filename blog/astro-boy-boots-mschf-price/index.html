Matter and Light<br>
A long time ago there was an angel of God who lived in the heaven and discovered that<br>
the electric light bulb really does make a mess of things.<br>
We can call this angel Michelangelo.<br>
He painted life on every surface, even in the toilet bowl.<br>
</p>
<p>And he knew the human body does not hold a place in the natural universe, but since it was his duty to share the creation,</p>
<p>
he painted his masterpiece in the form of a human being.<br>
And that is why the artist can be regarded as a gift from heaven.<br>
And even now it is impossible to say goodbye to him.<br>
</p>
