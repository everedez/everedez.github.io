<h1>Alleged Pizza Bar Rescue</h1>
<p>In April of this year two customers in Queens sued their two favorite pizzeria chains in the town of Southampton and Queens alleging they were falsely advertised as having pizza. The 2 defendants were the stores and the Pizza Bar they offered.</p>
<p>The Queens lawyers are quoted in an article in the Times-Union: “To say that the pizzas were deceptive would be to describe their high prices as the least of the problem.” However, in that article the lawyers mention that the customers were disappointed with the price of the pizzas and their fast delivery because of the “low quality.”</p>
<p>The owners of both defendants have said that they never said they were not open for business or if they were open for business they said that the pizzas were not worth having.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs suggested that the NY Times should be more involved in this case because the pizzas were found to be defective. They suggested that an audit was instituted by the New York State Liquor Authority to determine if the orders delivered were the defective pizzas. To the NY Times response the defendants were quoted: “These allegations were obviously false, but we are still reviewing the findings of that particular audit, so we cannot really comment on the accuracy of that audit at this point in time.”</p>
<p>The Times Union also quoted a NY State Police Uniform Crime Report that the pizza company claimed sold 0 units “of a particular type” they refused to name. NY Police are not able to determine whether the pizza “of that type” was defective.</p>
<p>The lawyers for the accused pizzas never mentioned any problem in their pizza or pizza chain of any kind!</p>
<p>After 9 months with no orders and customers still being informed that their pizzas were not worth a call to customer service both pizza chains sent cease and desist orders to both customers and attorneys. That is today the NY Times is now paying the money for the pizzas and all of the lawyers for both parties.</p>
<p>There really is no doubt that there are some problems with the pizza chains that is not disputed in the original lawsuit.</p>
<p>What is disputed in this article is the extent to which these pizzas can be blamed for problems with the pizza companies.</p>
<p>If there is a problem with the pizzas and pizza chains it is the lack of advertising that keeps customers away.</p>
