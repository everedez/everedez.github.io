<h3>French Frigate &amp;quot;Tartan&amp;quot;</h3>
<p>This is the Tartan. She was completed in 1938 and was launched in 1937 by De Bortoliys Shipbuilders of the Rheinland.  Until the war this ship was used by the German Navy as a minelayer and, since 1942, she has been operated by the French Navy. She was launched on 7 February 1936 and was commissioned by Admiral-Lieutenant Richard von Hipper on 24 September 1936.</p>
<p>The navy sold her in 1977. As of this date she is to be moored at the Naval Base Marigny - Mayenne (former Mancheste)</p>
<p>1936 saw the beginning of operation of the German Imperial Navy&amp;#x27;s escort fleet. Her coaming was painted a red stripe with the motto, &amp;quot;Von der französischen Frigate&amp;quot; (&amp;#x27;From the French frigate&amp;#x27;), which stayed on her throughout her service, alongside  and. After the Nazis came to power in January 1933,  also participated in actions in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1952 her first officer was Lieutenant Berthold Kernmeyer, he kept her cruising duties until her captain, Günter Schoppe-Bliesmann, took command, and she moved to Punsún (in the Bay of Biscay), where he managed her conversion for use by the French fleet. On 15 January 1945, escorting a squadron of French ships in the strait of Gibraltar, passed through the port. Despite receiving relatively little hostile fire in the first hour, she was hit by eight shells before the ship was saved, and the damaged ship was towed back to Bremerhaven.</p>
<p>On 31 October 1945 the crew fired upon the retreating German soldiers, causing a chain reaction of enemy fire that severely damaged the frigate &amp;quot;Tardain des Demoiselles&amp;quot;. Three of the dead were subsequently captured by the Americans when they returned on 31 October 1945. At the end of May 1945 the crews of British, French and other Allied ships who had been taking part in the battle on the western front were gathered at the port of Crete to be relieved by Allied troops.  On 21 May 1945, commanded by  who was escorting the British Task Force, had passed through the harbour.</p>
