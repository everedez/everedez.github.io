Ugh, Lister didn&amp;#x27;t watch YouTube before and even his channel doesn&amp;#x27;t feature many self-defense YouTube videos until very recently and none of his past entries contain anything referencing mass-kill videos either.
Hahaha, so don&amp;#x27;t get used to this.
Finally started after the long silence that was the second try to just talk about all the videos, but then I got his own Channel on ITC since I care about his life as a person which made the ending awkward :\(">

<p>Hahaha, so don&amp;#x27;t get used to this.</p>
<p>Finally started after the long silence that was the second try to just talk about all the videos, but then I got his own Channel on ITC since I care about his life as a person which made the ending awkward :\(</p>
<p>but come on, after only 2 weeks, it is kind of funny to watch his face grow while enjoying something I think is absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>well, it&amp;#x27;s finally over. I&amp;#x27;ll stop typing for a little bit though. I wish I could have been more able to chat with the guy. His behavior did not come off too well, but thankfully, I have found good friends whom I can discuss it with. I also give props to everyone who offered, after more than 2 weeks, to take control of the situation, they made another video on their channel, all the talk they had regarding the lack of self-defense videos all started up over the incident until someone got offended. I know that was shocking, but I hope it wasn&amp;#x27;t too much. They also made another video with the ending&amp;#x27;s explanation, but again after 2 weeks and that didn&amp;#x27;t help very much either since the person got offended even more. I hope this can all get over soon though, I feel quite bad about what happened since I knew what was going to happen after the release in my eyes, but still I felt really bad myself. If there was any potential for the cause of the situation to have been over, I would not have thought about this.</p>
<p>I know that this situation is an example of how nobody should have to put themselves between a bully and self-defense. I think that this is a very important lesson that everyone and anybody should learn the hard way. Whether you are a bully or not, you shouldn&amp;#x27;t allow yourself to make enemies before you even start thinking about the consequences of your actions.</p>
