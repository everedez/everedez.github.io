Our very first family together had a big surprise for everyone. My baby, as soon as I could get my head out of the swimming pool with a towel around my waist on Sunday, called me a ‘naughty woman’. So, much to my dismay, I responded to this with a pout and a ‘what- are- you- doing’ full of sarcasm.

<p>Our very first family together had a big surprise for everyone. My baby, as soon as I could get my head out of the swimming pool with a towel around my waist on Sunday, called me a ‘naughty woman’. So, much to my dismay, I responded to this with a pout and a ‘what- are- you- doing’ full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>30.31.15 [17]</p>
<p>Next to make her cry, my friend, Miriam, came over that night in her boxers to say some inane things to my daughter about her friends’ parents.</p>
<p>30.31.15 [18]</p>
<p>Miriam came over and just continued to have dinner with me whilst my daughter was, I fear, crying and attempting to fill up space. But I listened and I was polite and kind and dutiful and I didn’t say much of anything. And in the long run, it was just a lovely dinner, so that was worth it.</p>

<p>My two daughters fell out over school the last day of term. They were just tearing over stuff – actually, one of my daughters came up to me later and said she was so upset about why the new school uniform that she had to leave. I told her how much I was sad for her, that if her friend had to have a change of school clothes, she’d cry and I’d cry and she’d come back and be sad for her friend because she’d had to give up the old school uniform she likes so much. But she wasn’t having any of that. I told her straight that if she didn’t want to cry, get inside me, and if she was upset, get outside. And I will have no further of her. And it wasn’t for any particular reason that I couldn’t help but cry.</p>

<p>My sons have two very different fathers. My eldest son, Levi, got angry and said, ‘Aha, you are a mother?</p>
