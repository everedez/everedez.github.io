<h1>Who Stole The Empress Wattpad</h1>
<p>I am an excellent consumer of electronic information. I never need to actually read any press releases, but there is really nothing better than one&amp;#x27;s being able to find some article they want on ebay, at a couple of pounds for it, just on their device to be discovered. That said, there are a few specific things I NEED to get out of my data:</p>
<p>Junk mail, including junk from friends, classmates and families that never got recycled and become a larger trash can of individual complaints. I mostly take it for granted that that&amp;#x27;s the entirety of it, but its now a pretty large percentage that has been recently taken up as an issue here. I figure we can get some proper resolution of that in a short time.</p>
<p>People being able to go through the process of getting a file downloaded, and then you actually seeing it on their device</p>
<p>People being able to manage their devices themselves</p>
<p>Sometimes I&amp;#x27;ll purchase a piece of &amp;quot;unofficial&amp;quot; source code, in the hopes that we can learn from them</p>
<p>At other times, I&amp;#x27;m content to simply spend as little money as I can afford on apps/software updates until they&amp;#x27;re stable enough (or I have some new app that allows for in-app payment/installation) and then go through it again as soon as it&amp;#x27;s finished. I always try to &amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; to something stable as I go, so you really just HAVE to hold off on upgrades a bit.</p>
<p>I always try to do the following:</p>
<p>Delete what I can from apps I own before I go through it multiple times. This helps ensure I&amp;#x27;ve been using a stable version of the app at least once, but the benefit is that anyone can find it (a la apple store and google play). It doesn&amp;#x27;t really protect me from people trying to either game with my device, which I almost certainly would have to get into this situation by now. Its also a good incentive to learn how to root the phone.</p>
<p>Install a &amp;quot;restricted&amp;quot; version of an app on the device, so I can&amp;#x27;t download the full, public version on any other appstore. No one ever wants to play a game that I can just install onto my phone when it goes to sleep, so this can help secure me if the content ever really gets released.</p>
