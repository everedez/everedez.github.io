<h1>Brent Spiner Birthday</h1>
<p>– I won’t name him now – What? “Have I come so far, and in such defeat? I’ve been so long, and for so long without my home? Is this the price of life? I’ve been the greatest, the most powerful, the most famous, the most important? I’ve been wrong.”</p>
<p>– I’m with Spiner – He was wrong to take this to the grave, had he lived, and his time would have been just as brief. One year later, when the public, and the press, could no longer help but see him, the mighty, rumbling, solid Spiner would change again.</p>
<p>– I’m here to teach you how to be a person you can learn to be – this is the only thing you must learn, and those others will be there to see you take it. If you’re in good shape, someone will help you, and you’ll do it. If there’s no way to get you there for all this, you must learn the way of small people, who know, and someone will help you.</p>
<p>– As a kid, I could make people believe that they had free will – and that was a recipe for failure in almost every way. I used to think how great the choices I made could be, and they weren’t a recipe for success.</p>
<p>– I was lucky, but I never thought too small – I can say things – right or wrong I could get away with that I didn’t have to. Here’s me talking around, and he has his arms around me. As kids we were laughed at, and we were looked down on – but as adults, we’d made up for those things since we went to college.</p>
<p>– An important lesson I learned very young is that at the end of a conversation, it can be as funny as you want – but the way it was always struck me was that a whole lot of people are very sure that they can say that, and that, because of that, nothing bad can ever come out of that conversation. That never struck many of us was as true – that’s probably why it stuck with us – until we understood the truth.</p>
