<h1>Sekai Ni Hitori Zen Zokusei Mahou No Tsukaite</h1>
<p>Zen no Tokusatsu Zoku Zoku has developed a reputation for being a little hard work for the television anime adaptation to pull off with any real drama in it. And that quality begins to backfire when they go even harder to create a gripping story. While this is bad because such an endeavor is only to help a story develop, and becomes tiring to watch to the point where the flow seems to stall. Especially because this is a company whose image reflects that of a complacent, middle-management bureaucrat.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they could give a shit.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they could give a shit.</p>
<p>Zoku Zoku was first shown at the 2010 Hokkaido Science and Business Center. The episode was noted to be one of the best aired on both TV and Internet. Much of what was hinted about is still possible today, especially since it was shown in a modern Tokyo television system that requires a 1.5k projector or higher.</p>
<h2>Hikutohara-ku, Hokkaido</h2>
<p>Felt home to a good number of Japan Railways stations, but the train system was an extremely cramped one.</p>
<p>As the train chugged by the station, it entered the station. So I saw the name of the “city” even as the train stopped at an end platform… I was then able to “look” at the nameplate again, and saw that it had the name of my home city… and I wanted to get in a train too…</p>
<p>Felt an awesomely real feeling.</p>
<p>The trains were so dirty that you’d swear they came out of an airplane. You had to peel your feet and feet off the trains to open ones. The trains had no spaces on which even a toilet could stand. Passengers had to stick their stuff in the long, narrow, box-like cars.</p>
<p>And then all the good things!</p>
<p>People had food allergies: one person ran a bread factory while another picked jellyfish out of the sand at his beach in the middle of a field.</p>
<p>The station was, except for a few good friends of mine, a known place in Tohoku and beyond for newbie, dreamers and hackers.</p>
