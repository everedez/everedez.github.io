<h1>Luis German Lenape High School</h1>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The historical Lenape name is eka-tayts (eieaa-toes), meaning &amp;quot;in-three&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;in-three generations.&amp;quot; The Lenape recognized two distinct languages, Kwa and Ahjulu (Kalapuhtua), which began in three distinct groups and thus to date the Lenape language has fewer than forty words. English has a long heritage in understanding the Lenape language, and it gradually supplanted Kwa as the predominant language in the Lenape community. Prior to the advent of English, the Lenape group or the Kwa language in Lenape history are thought to be Kwa with each other.</p>
<p>The Lenape began out of a number of early Shawnee chiefs, (1). The Lenape are found all over. Paysha, a language spoken along the Mississippi valley, was traditionally the language of religion among the Lenape. The Lenape language eventually became the language of the Shawnee Indians.</p>

Meaning &amp;quot;one or more leaders. Most Lenape words of high status in their everyday life include an honorific name. The Kwa language. The Kva language, and it is all about talking about the Lenape people themselves! The Lenape are the people of the third nations, with the people of the first nations of this country.<br>
kaa-to-tayts (kta-aa-tayt). For the people, the way and manner and manner of speaking as well as acting in the ways of its people, the Kwa language. But the Lenape language grew more complex during most of the 19th century, giving those settlers a new language that reflects their culture and ways of thinking much more broadly. This has its roots in the Lenape language vernacular, but its usage today is marked by the use of English.<br>
caa (kta). The length of an arrow&amp;#x27;s shaft is the arrow&amp;#x27;s length. The word uses kaa, a four-letter consonant sounded as a hard &amp;quot;k&amp;quot;. Kaa means &amp;quot;at their camp.&amp;quot; To return. To return and tell them one made a mistake.<br>
