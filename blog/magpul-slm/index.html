The Magpul USHWT series leverages magwell technology to transfer heat from the barrel and up into the receiver to reduce its profile significantly and thereby contribute to the upper receiver’s structural stability. Designed by Magpul founder Jonny Larkin and based on the GFCI standard, each machine will comply with both EN14378, the new standardized safety and test procedure for cold hammer testing, and EN14378-2, the new test procedure for spring force and temperature testing.">

<p>The Magpul USHWT series leverages magwell technology to transfer heat from the barrel and up into the receiver to reduce its profile significantly and thereby contribute to the upper receiver’s structural stability. Designed by Magpul founder Jonny Larkin and based on the GFCI standard, each machine will comply with both EN14378, the new standardized safety and test procedure for cold hammer testing, and EN14378-2, the new test procedure for spring force and temperature testing.</p>
<p>When used in such areas as hunting rifle and sporting rifle applications, EN14378-2 has a two-year replacement warranty. The end of the warranty applies to Magpul products with which it is directly related (comprising UEG, DPMS G3, PGUs, SLFS, and SBS series shotguns, and the Magpul MA8 revolver), and supplies the service manuals for those brands.</p>
<p>The lower receiver of the MAGPUL Series (T5-3) is made from GFCI-compliant stainless steel and is complimented by a Magpul trigger cover, the MR-3 trigger guard, and the Magpul upper receiver handguard. This lower receiver offers a.223-caliber compatible frame which is surrounded by a 1.0-inch thick Magpul composite fiberglass stock (anodized black anodized). Magpul and the upper receiver are shipped unframed to the customer and installed with a pre-assembly kit that includes an in-situ adjustable sling and 3.5mm safety thumb safety. The sling is universal for most lower receivers, allowing use with various brands of CPM slings. The lower receiver is welded in place to the upper receiver.</p>
