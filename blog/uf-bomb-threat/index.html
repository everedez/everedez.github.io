<h1>Uf Bomb Threat</h1>
<h3>By the Associated Press</h3>

<p>A U.S. nuclear-trained ballistic missile launched &amp;quot;a precision guided ballistic missile&amp;quot; into the city of Mosul, Iraq&amp;#x27;s second largest city, Thursday evening. It&amp;#x27;s unclear exactly how many people were killed, but some Iraq and American military officials say that at least 10 people were killed, and multiple American aircraft with munitions have been reported damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>The Pentagon strongly urged their citizens and others to stay away from the area, citing a potential danger of a chemical or biological (biological) attack, and said it will ensure everyone&amp;#x27;s safety.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has said it will work &amp;quot;sensitively&amp;quot; to inform its citizens and others of potential dangers ahead. It has said it is working with the Iraqi government and some Kurdish-led militias to secure their military forces.</p>
<p>Additionally, U.S. warplanes and personnel have launched more than one hundred airstrikes on the Mosul area, but there have been no reported injuries to any U.S. personnel.</p>
<p>A U.S. aircraft was reportedly targeted in the strikes.</p>

<p>Iraqi forces have been battling Shiite militias throughout the country of 70 million people for more than five months, as violence criss-crossed the second most populous Arab country and people sought refuge in major cities in major cities, including Mosul, Iraq&amp;#x27;s second largest city, Thursday as fighting between militant forces and government forces escalated.</p>
<p>While militant-led forces were facing defeat, residents who were seeking safety after the loss of jobs and schools, and government efforts to bring their neighborhoods under government control were faced with another fight.</p>
<p>Iraqi forces say 60 insurgents have been killed, largely by roadside bomb attacks, and at least one U.S. Marine was killed in one nearby bombing.</p>
