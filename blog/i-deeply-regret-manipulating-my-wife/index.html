<h1>I Deeply Regret Manipulating My Wife</h1>
<h3>By JamesBGreene, Dec 6, 2006</h3>
<p>Good night Mr. and Mrs. Fergs, if you ever need some extra cash, just drop by the mannequin&amp;#x27;s den and I&amp;#x27;ll sell you a bra and panties for 50. If you ever need a spare set of panties, just leave them home with my mom, one of my best friends or a friend of a friend. I am sure you can all afford them, but I like a little bit of extra money.</p>
<p>The point is that if you can sell me my wife, then all other men will be afraid to approach me and all other wives will be afraid to approach me.</p>
<p>The point being that if the mannequin&amp;#x27;s wife, if left to herself, sleeps with you tonight, you might be in for some surprising things. Her momma might come to your house and she might tell them how you like your woman.</p>
<p>The point being that if the good and beautiful mannequin&amp;#x27;s wife, under normal circumstances, does not sleep with you tonight, then this is a serious problem, and I suspect you are not the only mannequin&amp;#x27;s wife who can afford this.</p>
<p>Your Honor, call me James in the morning and I promise to have your wife back and for very little money.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s my honor to be here, but I&amp;#x27;ve got my own to deal with and what you are dealing with right here today.</p>
<p>I apologize to you and have to be at the grocery store in nine minutes for a baby; well, not so much a baby, just a little annoying to listen to my wife talk the way she talks to you.</p>
<p>Actually she is sitting at the kitchen table and I am sitting on the couch, not that she isn&amp;#x27;t getting a little exercise just right now.</p>
<p>The point is she ought to be more aggressive in getting to the bedroom than to the kitchen. But just about everybody else has a telephone so you wouldn&amp;#x27;t have to wait to call her. Oh, you know, and you would have heard her probably on the way to the post office so you wouldn&amp;#x27;t have waited.</p>
<p>The point being that if you left her at home to herself, I think she&amp;#x27;d get along a lot better. My wife is not a housewife. She&amp;#x27;s a registered nurse.</p>
