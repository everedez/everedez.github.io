<h1>When Do Groundhogs Do An Eskimo Kiss</h1>
<p>During an Arctic winter in the US, I encountered some very interesting groundhogs: their heads were often just poking out of the snow covering the snowfields around them, or they traveled in packs, sometimes staying together in a loose mob of a hundred or so. Sometimes they hopped up into the air, rising 50 feet before landing gently on the ground (or sometimes landing on their noses).</p>
<p>The trouble began late one day when a skarcher (a big groundhog running around on its feet) decided to make good on its threat and pummeled a pair of groundhogs on their retreat. It wasn’t that the skarcher was hunting by any means; rather he was playing music for the occasion. As soon as the groundhog ran from the game and his friends let him go, the groundhog began to bound toward its mate, this time on a large home run. The skarcher was in an uproar. After all, the pair of groundhogs he had chased away were the only two to be seen on the night in question and they were apparently having a good fun at it—in all likelihood, this was in the way of the pair enjoying themselves. But when the skarcher was done with the pair, he went over to his friends and tried to tease them for playing.</p>
<p>“Goooobble, where the hooolygoggin’ are they?” he yelled. “Have you lost them?” “Oh, you’re a ‘bleh’,” said the skarcher, “a ‘bleeh’ skarcher.”</p>
<p>The skarcher continued, “Oh, you’re a ‘bleuh’! Your mates have scattered on the ice; they’ve gone to their friends and have fallen in it.” “So they’ve gone ‘bleh’, have they?” shouted the skarcher. “N-n-now that they’ve gone ‘bleh’, you two should all get together and we’ll try one on ‘im on the ice. You’ve already got yourselves a ‘bleh’.</p>
