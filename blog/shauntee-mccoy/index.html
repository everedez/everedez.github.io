<h1>Shauntee Mccoy</h1>
<p>This former All-American cornerback, who was selected in the first round of the 1993 NFL Draft, was a two-time All-American at Clemson and spent his final two years with the New York Giants. After that, he worked for several NFL teams, most prominently the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, from 1995 to 2001. Like his father, Tom, he&amp;#x27;s a past two-time Pro Bowler. He played his collegiate ball for the Clemson Tigers, wearing number 18. The Pirates, of course, wore numbers 12 and 20, so as to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>While most kids play hockey, Shawn, by virtue of his size (a 6&amp;#x27;4&amp;quot; 200-pounder) didn&amp;#x27;t have much chance to play. However, he seems to have caught an early interest among other kids and was often seen playing on the beaches and at football games. As a result, during football season, there was some sort of winter session in which he often took part and gained experience playing the game.</p>
<p>Along with his sisters, in 2003, he was named the state defensive player of the year in Alabama and the playoffs in the state title game. In 2004, he was honored as the Defensive back most influential player in America by The Players&amp;#x27; Tribune in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

<p>Character, character, character. As a young player in the NFL, he was incredibly energetic and a tough competitor. Defensive backs did something which no one else on the team enjoyed. Playing on your brother&amp;#x27;s team, it may be the only NFL experience you&amp;#x27;ve ever had so far on your own.</p>
<p>He was a strong competitor who was very vocal, when it came to getting the best out of his teammates. His father, Tom, who was the Giants&amp;#x27;s defensive back, coached the son on how to be a teammate.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;As a player he made it a point to get ready as soon as he was drafted,&amp;quot; Tom said. &amp;quot;I let Shawnt know what it took before he got put in front of the scouts, did it both ways and just treated it like a full-team sport.</p>
