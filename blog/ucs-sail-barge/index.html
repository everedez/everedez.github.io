<h1>Ucs Sail Barge</h1>
<p>A former ocean barge used to serve as a floating campus and was pulled out off of Florida soon thereafter.</p>
<p>The &amp;quot;Ulysses&amp;quot; barge broke up, this boat was lost, some people who knew it were doing me at this point, so I can&amp;#x27;t speak to exactly why the Ulysses stayed in the ocean.</p>
<p>However I do know for sure the original owner (Bruce) used to have a boat he used to work on. His first boat was a much larger vessel also used for various tasks that included a ship and smaller boats. A very larger fleet boat, and also used for various other purposes. I think these may be the types of boats you would be interested in owning. Bruce&amp;#x27;s boat may be worth the $100 million he paid for, as many of us have stated is asking to own a boat for that amount of money. People around the world knew Bruce, and he knew or thought he had some title to the boat that may have represented a boat for him to enjoy. I don&amp;#x27;t know how Bruce managed his boat but I hope someone else is looking into it for what they might say is a &amp;quot;silver lining&amp;quot; with the sale of his boat. Let go of their title.</p>
<p>Another boat used as his personal yacht. Likely on a section of lake he may have given over to his &amp;quot;family&amp;quot; and guests but never on the larger waters of the US or Europe.</p>
<p>A small boat used for pleasure cruises and more on adventures.</p>
<p>Another boat used for fun in and around the city but was rather rough and unrefined. Perhaps it was a one way adventure. The boat looked old and was in rough condition. There was no paper to sign up on the certificate of ownership.</p>
<p>This boat may have very low value. There is an assumption that it was built at a time when it was in better physical condition and a little more money could of been spent on improvements than on this boat. It may be one of those boat that always went out for a good time and then disappointed as the enjoyment stopped rather quickly. This boat could be worth quite a bit more considering the used boat condition it was in.</p>
<p>I would love to see a listing of all the boats he had on it and have them appraised.</p>
