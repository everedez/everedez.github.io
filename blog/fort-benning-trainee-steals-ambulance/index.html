<p>
The aftermath of trainee driver’s heinous act.<br>
By Steven H. Williams.<br>
September 1, 2007.<br>
</p>
<p>Marking an anniversary from yet another decade in which the late Ed Schumacher led the AFL–VFL in official match attendance figures, AFL Football Tiers announced the 2010 season-opening match between the Swan Districts and the Dandenong Stingrays at Moorabbin Oval, Sydney.</p>
<p>Tickets went on sale a little more than half-a-month ago, with the AFL-VFL Cup final against the North Melbourne Kangaroos expected to make it the highest-priced game for junior club tickets in the game’s history (the club had earlier used the best-paying game of 2007, an exhibition against rivals North Melbourne, to raise $160 000 for families of children killed in the Darwin bombings).</p>
<p>To be clear, AFL–VFL Cup ticket prices generally aren’t going up as a result of the match.</p>
<p>In fact it looks pretty likely that the majority of season-opening AFL games will have been sold out – and high-selling matches like the Toyota AFL Premiership Grand Final and St Albans versus Richmond have accounted for some of those profits.</p>
<p>So yes, it is a little disappointing that the match which is expected to make up the highest priced of these four games, is a Saints-Sydney contest.</p>
<p>The Saints are going to struggle to make up those losses.</p>
<p>The record crowds to their last two home matches – the first of which was last year’s Saints’ 30-point win over the Adelaide Crows – had proven enough. It was going to take more than a few ‘my tickets out of my pocket’ notes from around Sydney to redeem a game that had been sold out for eight days at Rlich Park. It is also unlikely they will do it tonight or tomorrow.</p>
<p>So the question immediately arises why the Club had the nerve to do that and, relatedly, why is this week’s match being honoured as an anniversary match by the AFL?</p>
<p>It is because they believe it is a mark to the past and future leadership of both clubs, and a very fitting time to celebrate.</p>
