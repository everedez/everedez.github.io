<h1>Gail Masset Murder</h1>
<p>
The &amp;quot;Masset murder&amp;quot; took place in June 1978.<br>
was an albino 19-year-old white male, Timothy Charles Weems, whom the Police identified as the second in line for the<br>
New Year&amp;#x27;s Eve spot which the Country Club had been allotted outside one of the large townhouses<br>
along W. 14th Street. (Weems&amp;#x27; family<br>
disavowed any connection but said that he had been residing on a summer vacation in Jamaica around<br>
July 1978)<br>
Details<br>
</p>
<p>of the murder&amp;#x27;s context were summarized as follows:</p>
<p>
New Year&amp;#x27;s<br>
Night: 9:50p.m., Weems, dressed in a black shirt and white dress, and carrying a black machete, walked<br>
to a bench just outside the Townhouse, near the back door, and sat down. Some four girls between 17 and 23<br>
were dancing on the other side of the street. A female teenager then joined them, and they saw Weems<br>
approaching. At first, they ignored him, and even when Weems turned to watch them they began to walk<br>
away. When they were out of earshot, the girl who had gone dancing returned to the scene, and the group<br>
quickly turned back. The group then converged on the location where Weems was sitting, and opened the<br>
door. [Some observers speculated on the timing of this<br>
event, saying that during<br>
Christmas, the earlier murder of Chris<br>
Donovan] Weems, along with at least one other person, entered the door. In the center of the room<br>
there was a large section of bookshelves that extended through the entrance to the path through the<br>
deserted house, which was in great disrepair at the time. The group then carried Weems to several large<br>
clothes racks across the room, and to the floor.<br>
Both police and<br>
the shooter say that Weems, to be<br>
included in the robbery, would not have been able to raise a knife unless his hands were bound at the<br>
time. Though the murder was considered a daylight<br>
stabbing, a good deal was<br>
known about the type of stab wounds, since this type of homicide was not considered serious.<br>
similar crime was committed the same day, June 10, 1978. Timothy F.<br>
