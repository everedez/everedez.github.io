<h1>Shein Urge Delivery</h1>
<p>Get it:</p>
<p>It is, in all likelihood, our best early bird deadline ever.</p>
<p>The Heinz market has risen from being a small one to a massive one, full of the most amazing array of brands and products at amazing prices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the bulk of that inventory was purchased from wholesalers who never think that they are dealing with a retail company with brand power and not just an internet brokerage.</p>
<p>So when Heinz became our first grocer in the US - and the only grocer on the planet - we knew we had to create our first press release.</p>
<p>
To do this you&amp;#x27;ll need some really cool fonts to put in the press release.<br>
And a creative story that will have our customers asking questions and writing in to the store.<br>
We can&amp;#x27;t wait!<br>
New Heinz Store Livery<br>
</p>
<p>A brand in its infancy, Heinz started off small in Seattle in 1998 with two stores and a few carts of stuff. As the brand grew it expanded to Seattle, Tacoma, Seattle Washington and then into Seattle and the Puget sound with stores in Everett, Kirkland, Issaquah, Mukilteo, Nanaimo and Victoria.</p>
<p>The Heinz that was purchased last year from local farmer Joel Luss, was a good mid-sized grocer which quickly became a winner among our customers.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s a very good market, and Heinz are the most well known grocer in the space. We plan to spend some time there over the next couple of weeks, and plan to discuss more as we move forward.</p>
<p>
Take your pick from our designs!<br>
We&amp;#x27;ve got some pretty creative prizes for you too!<br>

The Heinz website is broken with a real lack of &amp;#x27;In a Box&amp;#x27; &amp;#x27;Print&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;eCommerce&amp;#x27; categories. We&amp;#x27;ve got to fix that!<br>
</p>
<h2>Questions for the PR Agency:</h2>
<p>1. What do people need to take away from the press release? Any &amp;#x27;lessons to be learned&amp;#x27; or&amp;#x27;spark&amp;#x27; from the press release?</p>
<p>2. What do people in the PR community need to take away from the press release?</p>
