<h1>Eff My Anxiety</h1>
<p>Handsome is one of those songs that you cannot deny was made with an exact grammar for song composers like George Harrison. What’s more, one of the songs that was cut from the album was “Eff My Anxiety”—hence the title of this post. Let me explain what I mean by that. The lyrics in the song itself sound good, but some people were actually afraid of the song’s words, if you call it that. Why? A lot of the lyrics for this song are based on the relationship between someone else’s anxiety and yours. If you were really nervous, you’d be “effing” worry about the end of the world and God’s will on the issue. Other people were wondering why you could feel so anxious when you were in a bad mood. And these people were freaking everyone out. The song’s chorus goes something like “The sky, the sky is on fire”. Now we’re usually not concerned when the sky is on fire, but this is what everyone was worried about. They also worried they were too harsh for the lyrics that were too negative, or worse, if the song failed to be melodically nice, they were worried they would be judged for their bad taste! What a bunch of psycho, we’re not here to judge or preach anything. We’re not here to be your assistant. This is a nice song and it has definitely lived up to its intended listeners expectations, but it’s my opinion that the lyrics are a bit of an over-reaction to the song as a whole, and people weren’t too happy about that. I do believe, however, that there was someone down the line (or maybe even the whole “situation”) who really expected this song to be a sappy and clichéd piece of pop music, and it ended up sounding more like you are afraid to commit yourself to another person, “effing” it. But ultimately, I personally wished you could have done your own thing for once. If you had no choice, and you were called to be a part of something larger, try to make it a fun experience (hopefully once or twice). But you know, you don’t have to do that for 10 years.</p>
