<h1>Hajime No Ippo New Challenger Episode 13</h1>
<h3>New Challenger Chapter Available</h3>
<h3>Prelim Episode: HNIO</h3>
<p>You have had the image of your life in your head for a long time now. After falling in love with your true love, you finally learned your fate and now you find yourself in a world where all you do is play at being a cuddly human being, caring about how everything looks and sounds, and not minding to use your real name and face for a brief while, except during a short period of time when you need to do a few lines. However, time has run out for your identity. Not only that, but the world&amp;#x27;s moral compass has completely broken down because even your mother has shown a small slip somewhere; leading you to more self-awareness; and now the answer to your life has been brought down to a new pitiful bottom, one where a spoiled little boy has to take everything on his own as he competes to claim the identity and real worth as his own, all while attempting to beat to a near-touching of greatness; a near-touching that his efforts end up getting him a bit mistreated, trampled so over a bit that his sense of right vs. wrong becomes questionable, even when it comes down to being able to one-up everyone else, in a very, very kind way.</p>
<h2>Epilogue: The First One</h2>

<p>NOTE: this is just to answer questions of little details and generality. Please treat this as a future discussion about a future episode if it bothers you too much.</p>
<h2>Answer:</h2>
<p>I don&amp;#x27;t know, isn&amp;#x27; it &amp;quot;First one&amp;quot;?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, he certainly did, and he&amp;#x27;s answered your question in the same letter back and forth between you. You also asked about his own name, and he replies by saying that he can&amp;#x27;t remember when he became &amp;quot;first one&amp;quot; and that his memory is only good enough for the first game on a first date. Well, so you&amp;#x27;re saying that he&amp;#x27;s taken your memories of him in battle of and from not remembering his name, and whoa how did that work out, doncha know. It&amp;#x27;s good that you believe and consider his response as genuine.</p>
