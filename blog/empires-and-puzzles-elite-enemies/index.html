<h1>Empires And Puzzles Elite Enemies</h1>
<p>A mission just got a bit worse thanks to the rising power of the powerful king of the Sea Islands and an enemy that has the ability to swallow an entire army that was lost in the previous week, losing four different heroes. Everyone is out for blood, and so the Emperor wants his chance to show he is still the “King of the Seas”. A super-maxed ship in the midst of battle carries three heroes who are heavily pressed, and it just so happens that they’re all heroes that know how to use the latest version of the Internet.</p>
<p>Evil Loki and Loki are two time-traveling emperors of the Sea Islands. They were well known heroes, now known only as “evil” but in many times before, they were far more powerful than they are now.</p>
<p>And the Emperor is standing at the entrance of the cave with the warriors, ready for yet another battle against a newly made enemy. Both emperors know the two lads very well, but they are ready to test their new found power, and the Emperor knows the better knowing, it’s their own people that pay the price.</p>
<p>Loki, as you know, resides only in the Sea Islands that are home to the emperors. Evil Loki lives in the modern era, and is in constant danger, as he has always been the loyal protector of the emperors, and he stands by his side with his sword ever ready to protect them. He is quite confident about the strength of his enemies and makes sure they are as ready as they can be.</p>
<p>Loki is just ready to face his foe, if only the two emperors are ready to show the world who Loki is, and who they are facing.</p>
<p>“The Emperor wants to decide”, cries Loki. In the distance the Emperor is seen with his half-hyenas, who wish to show him how strong and tough it is to be a King. Seeing his old enemy go the way he went, Loki knew Loki could feel it too.</p>
<p>“You know the plan…” continue Loki, his half-hyenas accompanying him. “The power of the emperors is very powerful. We can use them both to our advantage, and see who takes the power of Earth to rule supreme!</p>
