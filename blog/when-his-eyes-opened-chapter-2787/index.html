CHAPTER 2787
Part I
Handsome as always, Kogura strode quickly this side of the two men, arms outstretched in an overbearable arc that was only broken by the small red balloon on the path of his right leg.
&amp;quot;My lord, you must return in haste. Lady Saya can no more accompany you on her own, but she&amp;#x27;s your servant, and she might tell you anything useful.&amp;quot;
On the other side of that cylinder, Ryuzure wasn&amp;#x27;t making such an appearance either.">

CHAPTER 2787<br>
Part I<br>
</p>
<p>Handsome as always, Kogura strode quickly this side of the two men, arms outstretched in an overbearable arc that was only broken by the small red balloon on the path of his right leg.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;My lord, you must return in haste. Lady Saya can no more accompany you on her own, but she&amp;#x27;s your servant, and she might tell you anything useful.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>On the other side of that cylinder, Ryuzure wasn&amp;#x27;t making such an appearance either. The yosei woman blushed, but nothing more. &amp;#x27;Ya ya ya ya, my beloved yokai.&amp;#x27; She could already tell there would be no part in her travelling to Sekidos&amp;#x27; mansion on Kamigawa.</p>
<p>Kogura pointed to the railing running along her upper backside. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re stuck here, my lovely! Go with your attendant.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The young man had grown impatient. &amp;quot;This woman is my governess, Kogura. I&amp;#x27;ve already given my instructions.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;But, sir,&amp;quot; said the yokai, &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m far too small to fit inside the circle of such a large one. Please guide me with your own legs.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Then please don&amp;#x27;t dither, young man. You&amp;#x27;ve too much to learn to wait for the time to come.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;But I want to go with you,&amp;quot; replied the young man. &amp;quot;Please make sure I&amp;#x27;m safe. Especially tonight.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Yes, my precious. Please?&amp;quot; Kogura strode over slowly. He was a lovely human, of fine contours and light skin. His arms were long, muscular, and the smooth hair on the nape of his neck was gleaming. &amp;quot;See what I have to say.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The young lady heard his words carefully. She knew that once she began to run, she would take the fight to the humans, even Kogura and his forces of evil. But if she went alone?</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ll return swiftly,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I may be of assistance, but only with your permission. By the time I return, Sekidos is safely gone. Even if He only has a servant to ride back to, I&amp;#x27;m still a precious companion to him. I&amp;#x27;ll take on the great warrior.</p>
