<h2>General Medical Resusitations</h2>
<p>Patients will find the following information on the medications in the permanent access link which is located on the upper right portion of the page under the medical column next to the drug name:</p>
<p>Common side effects</p>
<p>Drugs with a common side effect or effects include allergic reactions like skin, mouth, eye, and respiratory reactions related to the medication and infusion complications. These are related to the fact the medications are filled under the same formularies, then shipped to the pharmacy and to the patient within a specific timeframe. The medication most often, but not always, associated with each of these, are for example Clotrimazole (Trimethoprim), Percodan (Percodan), Ceftibuten (Sisal), and Dextromethorphan (Cianthespine). These are for example generics, or generic and brand only medications. The other drugs are not always known for the same side effects and complications. The medications side of effects &amp;amp; complications listed below are seen on the following pages. To better understand the complications, note in each of the four main categories: Generic Medications; brand only medications in each of these four categories, Independent Drugs that require hospitalization, Independent Drugs that require blood testing, or Independent Drug combination of medications that require hospitalization and combination of brands not already listed.</p>
<h2>Additional Symptoms Common Side Effects</h2>
<p>Another option for creating medications as a class is to put some key symptoms in which they usually occur and the effect the drugs should have, like 1a) Pain at infusion or other invasive treatment, 1b) Hemorrhage, 2) Nausea, 3) Weight gain, 4) Diarrhea, and 5) Jaundice.</p>
<h2>Key Symptoms</h2>
<h3>Kreutzfeldt-Jackson.</h3>
<p>A rash, or a swelling on the palms and soles of the hands or feet that is accompanied by or causes a feeling of heat and is not a blood pressure change is not necessarily considered a complication of the medication.</p>
