<h1>Glorious Howl Destiny 2 Triumph</h1>
<p>It was long ago that I left Glorious Howl</p>
<p>as a solo player in Destiny 2 at the start of the new year to become part of the vast success of the MMO. And this is a truly important thing to note. Whilst we are now playing the game solo, it has not been done by random attrition on the part of the community. Instead, it has been by design by Bungie’s chief creative officer, J communication specialist Mark Cerny.</p>
<p>I found out about these plans in a meeting which was taking place in my office in the days after I had left Glorious Howl. I had arrived with a few of my teammates and we were discussing our plans. The plan is that everyone who came in as a solo player will be giving a shout-out of some sort on the website and on the walls of our offices. This will help the solo community do their part to cement it as an amazing community with a fantastic set of heroes.</p>
<p>You can request a name which we will put right by your friends to win an awesome Legend. This will send positive reinforcement to the many awesome solo players out there who are trying hard to be awesome. Think back to the time you were a solo legend and you managed to create a fan-based campaign for your heroes and it started a massive online campaign around the world. Or maybe you are a hero myself and have been played for a long time because the community started to leave for a different game.</p>
<p>From this point on we are slowly re-allocating our time to an end-game play mode, the Glorious Howl Classic PvP. This will be a casual PvP mode which we will play to introduce the casual community to the online community.</p>
<p>So, all of these upgrades we are putting in place. Glorious Howl is doing this for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly the solo experience is not equal. We are going to make it as easy as possible for anyone who lives in our area to play solo. Secondly, if anyone thinks that it is fair that our community makes the top 50 in all of the PvP games, now is the time to take back some of their glory. The titles you will be putting in your lineups won’t be because of random happenstance but you are doing so because you deserve to because of where you are in the rankings.</p>
