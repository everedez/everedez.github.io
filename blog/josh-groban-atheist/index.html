<h1>Josh Groban Atheist</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The path of this blog is to share my experience of living in the modern world, whether it be observing daily life and experiencing its trials and tribulations; or the highs and lows of relationships, the art and science of sex, or other such stories.</p>
<p>I have had three blogs before this one. The first is called Deception of the Pavement, where I described the problems I had with being a non-believer, and I referred to the one I am sitting before as The Paradox. The second one I did after I had been a non-believer for a few years, but then became a believer again. It’s still available, but I am going to keep that one for some years longer. The current one is going to be a bit of a moving on from my past two, as it is my final Blogging Years Book Chapter that I write.</p>
<p>I hope for many many years to come that when I am alive some people in the future will not have to listen to me in their household, and when they are in someone else’s house, they will have the ability to walk out the door and not hear anything I say.</p>
<p>I’m not telling your children what to do,</p>
<p>But trying to illustrate what they should or shouldn’t do.</p>
<p>There isn’t one way that all religion or all non-belief is wrong so much as it’s all true and it’s all true as it relates to you personally. What I’m offering here is by no means the whole picture, but it is the sum total of my perspectives on each.</p>
<p>First off, one of the true and underlying issues that people today want to be atheists or something so they can experience the pain and misery that many atheists experience in their personal lives. Atheism isn’t the answer, but it is a step in the right direction that I look for when it comes my personal pain and suffering.</p>
<p>If we don’t like how we are living today, we’re either going to change for the better or we’re going to give up and get some help from someone else to change our perspective and see things for what it is.</p>
