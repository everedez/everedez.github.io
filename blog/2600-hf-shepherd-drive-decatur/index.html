<h1>2600 Hf Shepherd Drive Decatur</h1>
<p>It takes a village to raise a kiddo--or the sort of village we grew up in. This is our humble story of how one small town, one big, long-term commitment, and a lifelong way of life has helped us grow a family of four into one of our most wonderful kiddos.</p>
<p>The back story to this part involves a long-standing feud (and slightly unpleasant character) that occurred between my parents at one particularly painful time. Needless to say, it has left me with a bit of a bruised ego for the next forty years.</p>
<p>Our story begins--I&amp;#x27;ll skip detail if its not germane to the larger story but you can find it in our family scrapbook for some reason. Please use comments to share our story and if your sharing is bringing a smile I&amp;#x27;ll try to let them have a small donation to go toward the project of a new home for one of our kiddos. We love you, too.</p>
<p>Papa and I had been back from the annual munchkin outings of our daughter Lucy&amp;#x27;s life without a hiccough for the better part of six years at that point. (Well, depending on what kind of hiccough it was, we both rather liked it...lots of coughing, spitting, gagging of the food, and I hate to say it, even sucking up the nasal mucus has taken some getting used to.) A baby came along about that time and our days were getting busier than usual. A move (it was about time finally) came up, it was booked, and there was no reason to go as it was a possibility for both of our families involved in it.</p>
<p>So we thought it best to keep our munchkin travels private and let the time fly by. It didn&amp;#x27;t work out quite that way, our thoughts and energies were going into expanding our daughter&amp;#x27;s day with lots of play dates, well-cooked lunches and tasty dinners without which we could not (or might not have the energy to) catch up on munchkin duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the idea of having another child was and is so heart wrenching for both of us that we thought the time had finally come.</p>
