<h1>Byroe Tofu Gel Cream</h1>
<p>Today’s recipe features a Japanese Herbs/Seasonings item, a creamy version of a popular Asian Superfood, Yogurt made from the naturally occurring “*Baiya/Thai Green Garlic Paste” or “*Baiya/Thai Green Garlic Paste”. The purpose of this paste is to bind “good” proteins into the Yogurt – to “protect”. This paste acts as a prebiotic fiber, stabilizing your probiotics to prevent overgrowth of probiotic organisms, and helping your immune system to work more efficiently against these organisms. It also helps provide an “anti-cariogenic” or “anti-cancer” aspect to the Yogurt, in that it acts as an exfoliant, naturally removing surface tissue during the yogurt’s fermentation process.</p>
<p>The next time you enjoy a smooth and creamy Yogurt from your local store, try this lovely garlic herb paste as a healthy alternative. After removing the skin from the garlic cloves, squeeze the flesh of the cloves to facilitate it release its flavor and liquid when you cook it. This recipe will work with any other variety of garlic that you desire – but fresh or pickled garlic from the counter top works well.</p>
<p>Note: Daiya is the Japanese word for garlic cloves, or the Thai flavoring named, Saijang/Searang. If you are a bit health-conscious with your diet, don’t feel the need to add garlic to your shopping for other Asian Superfoods, Saijang/Searang can also be used in the same recipe, along with other types of onion, such as red onion. For most of us, red onion is not ideal because it has a stronger flavor and is easily overpowering.</p>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>This recipe will work well with any other variety of garlic that you desire – but fresh or pickled garlic from the countertop works well. Shove the garlic cloves in the center of an inverted glass tray, or a muffin tin. Depending on how thick you like your garlic cloves, this may take a few minutes to a few hours or at least 15 to 20 minutes. Be sure to keep the tray or tin inverted as you continue to knead the garlic paste. Eventually the paste will form a clump.</p>
