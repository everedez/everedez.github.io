<h1>Gipsy Kings Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu</h1>
<h3>New Series, 2 Channels</h3>
<p>This is a continuation of the New York TV Guide, and since this year I had a couple new shows on that list to upload which were too well-known to be uploaded. You can check them out at this link.</p>
<p>Pattinson is back, as we now know, along with his friends from their first season of The Magicians. This is a show that still has a big fan-base and is consistently good. Again, thanks to the good folks at the New York TV Guide, thanks you too, for allowing me to upload their uploads to this site.</p>
<p>What to expect in this new series?</p>
<p>Travis is on a new adventure in his life. He has been away from school and all of the friends he made, but he has to go back to ‘home.’ Unfortunately, that means going to ‘home’ as well, but it’s not going to be the first time Travis will go to ‘home’.</p>
<p>He is accompanied by Tasha, Riley, and Lassie, who are all new to the show. They bring Travis’ memories back from their own childhoods, and once again, while going back to ‘home’, he is drawn a new home for himself at Wenda’s house.</p>
<p>While there, he finds the secret that starts his desire to find that home too.</p>
<p>Travis and his friends finally find their home in the magical kingdom</p>
<p>This episode features some very cute creatures that Travis will have to help protect. He is now very excited to play dress-up, putting on the best clothing he is able to find, or even meet the real Princess Gipsy Princess.</p>
<p>Aside from her ‘trademark’ green dress, this episode also features some actual princesses wearing those kind of dresses. Travis and Riley are quickly becoming a thing, as were Tasha and Lassie too. It was fun to see even them wearing more stuff than regular princesses. However, her pink flower ornament and various princess related items are gross. It is also one of those really cute episodes where you finally get to see the new Princess and Prince show off their sense of humor.</p>
