<p>The Top 10 Features of Fortnite, a free to play game in which players take the role of soldiers to fight against other players on a Battle Royale style game. Read on to learn more about Fortnite features that will help you start playing the game competitively.</p>
<h2>Make Your Own Heroes</h2>
<p>Fortnite is set within an innovative and open world. This allows for players to create their own unique players through the customization of powers and abilities. It’s the perfect place for players to come up with their own character and build a team that they can push towards the win.</p>
<p>If you’re learning to play battle games, make your own soldiers to take down the opposing forces. There’s no better way to spice up your first few games than to keep an eye on your friends at the table and see that they’ve built their own unique teams. Just like Overwatch, Fortnite offers a flexible system for players to create and manage the team.</p>
<h2>Build a Strong Team</h2>
<p>Building a strong team is an indispensable part of winning games with Fortnite. Though players will face setbacks as they play, they shouldn’t have to worry about the fate of their soldiers. It’s the start of a long gaming career. With no PvP, Fortnite can really focus on their economy and build for success with their soldiers.</p>
<p>A solid team can win a lot of games in Fortnite, thanks to its strength in innovation. You can expand your army, recruit allies, attack enemy players, upgrade your vehicles, etc. A strong Fortnite team may be the start of a winner’s career.</p>
<h2>Build Items</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, you can build to win. But make sure you build something to break the curse of items dropping. Item prices keep on skyrocketing. You could end up spending much money on buying the item when it feels like there’s no better way to use it. Keep in mind that the prices of items can vary greatly from region to region.</p>
<h2>Deter the Curse</h2>
<p>The items you put into your inventory are the best way to break the curse of not being able to buy the best equipment. Here’s how.</p>
