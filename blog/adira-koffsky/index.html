Also great to read something different from many coins that also incorporate aspects of the 5&#43;5 block. Of course I think it&amp;#x27;s important to note how much of Bitcoin we basically all know and understand without the 5&#43;5 block, which almost makes me feel like I just spent my entire time being on the internet questioning Satoshi when he was supposed to still be working at _doing what Satoshi was trying to do_.">

<p>Also great to read something different from many coins that also incorporate aspects of the 5+5 block. Of course I think it&amp;#x27;s important to note how much of Bitcoin we basically all know and understand without the 5+5 block, which almost makes me feel like I just spent my entire time being on the internet questioning Satoshi when he was supposed to still be working at _doing what Satoshi was trying to do_.</p>
<p>As always I wish it was possible to make things interesting from now on, but then why make it hard on the protocol, even with a few changes, to allow new ideas to be good enough for humans to understand and promote their adoption when it&amp;#x27;s all, in my opinion, basically boring?</p>
<p>I think the question Satoshi is stuck with is whether the 5+5 block is doable without fundamental changes or not, as with even other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>To be honest I probably would have preferred a 7+7 and even still many, especially those more blockchain oriented coins, would come out with an interesting and interesting 7+7 implementation, but any one of those options definitely might not be what Satoshi would have liked, hence at least at the moment I&amp;#x27;m waiting for him to come back to our systems and find such a model actually viable.</p>
<p>I, of course, hope to see Satoshi later on in 2018 doing something new and exciting, but at the moment I feel even as a bit bored with the whole blockchain / 7+6 / 5+5 block / whatever combination it could be defined or called nowadays. To quote my favorite philosopher and a software developer:</p>
<p>&amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re never finished coding, you never finish being a computer programmer. All programming is the same: adding features to something, building it up from the ground up, discovering the bugs, getting your code right, taking your chances if it works, if it crashes or you don&amp;#x27;t like it, adding more features, bigger bugs and making it work somewhere more difficult or more effective better.</p>
