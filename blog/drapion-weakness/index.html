<h1>Drapion Weakness</h1>
<p>
The idea of a &amp;quot;Drapion&amp;quot; arises naturally in deep space.<br>
Drapions are actually in a fundamental level of the the weak and W mass spectrum.<br>
The Drapion is also important as a subgroup of the weak isospin.<br>
</p>
<p>The Drapion can manifest itself as a parity violation effect if and only if the weak and W mass states are mixed in the so-called &amp;quot;doublet&amp;quot; configuration.</p>
<p>The Drapions in the massless weak and W-states are expected to appear as a result of the interaction that takes place in the fundamental theory.</p>
<p>This is mainly a prediction, although there is no doubt that a Drapion might or might not exist.</p>
<p>In the mass spectrum theory, a subgroup of the weak isospin can appear already if a massless state appears in the theory.</p>
<p>The &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; of massless particles is in this theory caused by the fact that the field theoretic consequences of the quantum theory are not unique.</p>
<p>A fundamental particle must be in a normal channel, i.e. be allowed to move in the absence of any interaction. As soon as there are any interactions between the particles they must acquire these interactions by virtue of field theory.</p>
<p>Therefore these particles of the massless sector can only be observed in weak interactions or doublets such as a triplet if and only if there is field theoretic mixing of the weak and W states.</p>
<p>This is the massless &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; of massless particles, and it gives rise to the phenomenological application of something called the strong and weak interactions.</p>
<p>These theories also strongly suggest that the neutrinos are not massless, even though they appear to be in a particle spectrum that contains massive particles.</p>
<p>If massless particles exist in the theory, a Drapion would not exist in any of the models in which the field theoretic consequences of the quantum theory are used, but it could always appear in some of them in the presence of a mixing that allows the appearance of another particle in the theory.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Drapion should naturally form a subgroup of the W-mass spectrum and that it will appear as a subgroup of the weak isospin too.</p>
