<h1>Yasin Cengiz Died</h1>
<h3>T-2: Tormod.</h3>
<p>We were told this by Tormod 2. I noticed he had the same wound on his right leg as Cengiz died.</p>
<p>We may understand that while Cengiz was still away on his mission to destroy the Tokishima, he was being rescued in their attempt to achieve that mission by his compatriot Sujtas who (like him) was acting without the authority of the “Jida Clan”.</p>
<p>We see that Cengiz was shot and the wound was caused by a laser ray from Sujtas. Because of the power of the Tokishima’s weapon, Cengiz was killed instantly. Sujtas therefore was less than unaffected by the blast that occurred in front of him when he saw the wounded Cengiz.</p>
<p>So where exactly does this story break down? The most interesting part (at least to me) is that, in the Shikisen Waza</p>
<p>Cengiz was a Tokishima Ranger, a warrior with no equal in all Zuma&amp;#x27;s series! He was the only one in the Tokishima who was equally proficient and adept with many ranged weapons, and was particularly great with the Bachi-Scope (one of Tokishima&amp;#x27;s favorite weapons).</p>
<p>&amp;quot; This is not the first time Sujtas brought something to the Zuma. How did you come up with it?</p>
<p>Sujo. Though he is regarded as one of the best Zuma Ikoma I have met, Sujo was certainly not to everyone&amp;#x27;s liking. He would usually fight dirty, even lying to his superiors and friends. However, towards the end of the war, he fell out with his troops, and was a frequent rebel against Zuma at every opportunity! Although Sujtas fought on both sides of the war, he chose to fight against his younger comrade.</p>
<p>Sujo was one of those rare Tokishima warriors whose actions and actions he had to fight every turn. He was known to attack by whatever means necessary if he thought they were not getting the job done, or to defend a fallen unit who he knew had no idea that he was actually being attacked.</p>
