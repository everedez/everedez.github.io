<h1>Claisen Adapter</h1>
<p>Wei Xing was back this summer after her long hiatus. I can&amp;#x27;t describe how I miss her. As you know, she was pretty boring. You know what else was boring. She wasn&amp;#x27;t too interested in basketball or baseball. She was a freshman. And she wasn&amp;#x27;t particularly good at singing. She came to English because she was a big fan of baseball.</p>
<p>Well, I found out that Wei Xing listened to a lot of music. A lot of music, actually. She wasn&amp;#x27;t really a music person. There is a story behind how I found this out, because the last time I heard a recording was just yesterday.</p>
<p>She was quite the music snob. I want to use the term &amp;quot;sensitive&amp;quot; here. I don&amp;#x27;t mean she wasn&amp;#x27;t actually interested. She was, but it isn&amp;#x27;t that she didn&amp;#x27;t like music, it&amp;#x27;s that she didn&amp;#x27;t like listening to it. She had no taste. She would just listen for hours and hours and hours and hours on a certain type of music that came from a certain genre. She wasn&amp;#x27;t really interested in that type of music. I think she would just listen to all kinds of music. Yeah. A lot of bluegrass, a lot of pop, blues, and a lot of rock, basically anything that could be bought at a souvenir shop. I would just listen to it with her on the flight.</p>
<p>But the bluegrass was...well, it wasn&amp;#x27;t even that easy for me to describe. A little girl from the countryside was from the countryside. Now, I had never heard of the Bluegrass Band before. After the airplane we just started singing. And since we were singing, we had to sing a lot, and so that made us sound like...how do I put this...disheveled guys, right? Well, they didn&amp;#x27;t sound like a disheveled guy at all, they sounded like just a typical girl talking to her boyfriend on her flight. Actually, that&amp;#x27;s really the most interesting part about the experience. It helped to break down any stereotypes you might have about who these singers were.</p>
<p>No, I wasn&amp;#x27;t actually that sensitive to the music.</p>
