<h3>Partner:</h3>
<p>Elli Rhiannon Müller Age The woman who holds no titles, owned the Rhiannon estate for most of her forty years, until her own son and grandson inherited it.</p>
<p>Sharing in the family fortune</p>
<p>In fact, as of the beginning of 2016, both of their net worths lie in excess of $18 billion, second to only Forbes&amp;#x27; list of richest African Americans!</p>
<p>Elli Rhiannon Müller, the 50 year old woman who served as the “grande dame” of her Dania Beach estate, the family&amp;#x27;s seat for over two generations, along with her 31 year old son Jordan, has accumulated five dogs, a gold-plated golf car, $88 million in life insurance, “three houses in Malibu, Laguna, California,” a new home in Atlanta and “a lifestyle that borders on the exotic,” according to her Facebook fan page, the RhineNid Estate, where she now lives.</p>
<p>According to one of her current “web acquaintances,” Ms. Müller and Jordan, who also resides in Los Angeles, “have met in business. She actually owns two of the 5 of their dogs, an old rescued Belgian Malinois, El-Rawi, and a grey husky, Lai-Yzeem, who has the proud distinction of being the first dog to have a world record for longevity established. She also manages to have all the proceeds from her several properties put together into a joint account to enable her to fully enjoy the fruits of her life. Her wealth truly has come to be, by and large, through the generosity of others and the kindness of God Almighty.”</p>
<p>It is through the generosity of others that she and her family have acquired all of the properties at which they reside.</p>
<p>The first leg of Ms. Müllers property portfolio was bought by “a man named David,” according to her Facebook page. She began raising the Dania Beach estate on her own. In fact, “the real estate office that she employed as the estate manager never took off, and she says she owed the bank $38,000 so they stopped lending her money without any reason or explanation.</p>
