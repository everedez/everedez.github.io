<h1>Liam Hemsworth Suing Miley</h1>
<p>Just a few minutes ago, Miley became the target of a lawsuit by a UK woman who considers herself to be Miley&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;fiancé&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>The UK woman, Mary Gee, filed a lawsuit against Miley in March, in UK&amp;#x27;s Court of Appeal, after her feelings &amp;quot;were &amp;quot;driven away&amp;quot; by a text from Miley in the summer of 2018. The lawsuit named Miley and his agent, Jheri.</p>
<p>This is a ruling by the court which could expose Jheri, Miley&amp;#x27;s agent. And as an actor, he could be placed under oath with the court, about Miley.</p>
<p>Here&amp;#x27;s the full text of the ruling:</p>
<p>The case of Mary Gee, against Jheri Smith, Liam Hemsworth and their agency All Star Entertainment,</p>
<p>The High Court is the highest court of the UK and sits at the end of the court of appeal. It has already had its first hearing on the complaint of Mary Gee against Jheri Smith, Liam Hemsworth and their agency All Star Entertainment, and they are now going to argue their case before the court.</p>
<p>Mary Gee (53) has filed the case of Mary Gee v Jheri Smith on the 19th March 2019 and at the hearing has put on evidence by herself, her son Andrew Gee, Andrew&amp;#x27;s lawyers, a senior Law Officer from the High Court acting for the defendant (Jheri) Smith and the same Law Officer asked for time to deal with a document he prepared which his client never saw, if she could ever receive a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Mary Gee&amp;#x27;s case was referred to Law Officer, (High Court) Mr George Downey, to begin the case. Mr Downey then gave a statement at the hearing about Mary Gee&amp;#x27;s case.</p>
<p>The case against Jheri Smith, Liam Hemsworth and All Star Entertainment (All Star Entertainment), for the termination of Mary Gee&amp;#x27;s marriage with Miley Cyrus is part of an investigation by the Claims Agency, The Chartered Institute of Business &amp;amp; Law. The Claims Agency is not involved in this matter and the case, in particular the case of Ms Gee before this Court is being pursued by them under powers delegated to me by the Advocacy Act 2003.</p>
