About Kudus<br>
</p>
<p>Kudus is an American hip hop group and one-half of the production team Kudus who was founded in Los Angeles, California by Dr. Jada Pinkett Smith, a renowned recording artist, and Derek Dessner, a Grammy award-winner. The two met at a birthday party for Smith&amp;#x27;s daughter Hannah which Dessner also attended on a school trip to Los Angeles. At the time, Dessner and Smith had been recording as a duo under the name, DJ Muggs. By the time the duo had independently released their first album, Dr. Jada Pinkett Smith &amp;amp; The Kudus, the name Kudus was coined. The album brought the duo nationwide attention and gained both the producer and the artist attention as the duo won Best New Artist in 2007 at the APRA Awards. The duo have continued to release an album a year since then, although this is more sporadic than the previous album. Among their earliest hits, the duo have created hit songs for Sean Paul, Jazmine Sullivan, Frank Ocean and more than a dozen others.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Hey DJ/Kudus- I’m so excited to be on the first episode of the Kudus Podcast on the most recent BHBR episode. I’m super pumped to talk with you all about my show and what I’ve been hearing from you people since I’ve been on the show. Kudos to every one of you for being my listeners and for commenting, sending me some dope links from what you’re listening to right now and sharing it on your own blogs. If you’re a fan of Kudus, I can’t wait to share my process with you. I believe in a damn good thing and sometimes I think every day. Let’s get right into it..&amp;quot; - Dren and Dessner</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I just have to tell you how grateful I am for everything you’ve brought into my life and how happy it makes me to share it with you on the “Kudus Podcast”. I have fallen in love with Kudus ‘D.J.</p>
