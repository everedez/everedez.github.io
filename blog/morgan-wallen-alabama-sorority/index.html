<h1>Morgan Wallen Alabama Sorority</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The purpose of the Alabama Sorority is to positively enhance the activities of the alumni, students, community, and the university at large. Membership is open to anyone interested in joining to gain the benefits of living in a sorority. The first graduating class was approximately 35 in 1915 and it grew into 50 by the start of World War II. While membership of the Alabama chapter was restricted to the active membership, women who wanted to study or work to get a degree did so in order to get a member number and move on to the next level. We offer many student organizations that are for all ages. One of these is for boys, the Almond Creme Scholarship. This scholarship offers a college-level scholarship for a student. The college year lasts 6-9 months. For more info and an e-mail address, visit http://almonestaylor.com/home.</p>
<p>Our members are involved in many different functions: campus organizations, community organizations, alumni associations, student government, and most importantly, their men&amp;#x27;s clubs.</p>
