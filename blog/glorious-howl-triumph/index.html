About Joe Bell<br>
</p>
<p>Joe A. Bell, a Shasta Valley native, is an award-winning singer-songwriter and guitarist. He has performed widely in the Northwest, regionally in the California cities of Portland, Eugene, Barstow, Healdsburg, and San Francisco, and more widely around the United States--including stints performing at California&amp;#x27;s finest venues on the West Coast: The Doorbell Box at the lovely Pacific Place; the Biltmore Santa Monica Hotel, and the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco--and in Portland, Oregon, among other venues, and has graced the pages of some of the Northwest&amp;#x27;s top folk magazines. Joe has toured with the likes of David Sancious, Steven Townson, Kris Willey, and Alex Rivera. He worked with the likes of John Fahey, Hal Kokena, Bill MacIntyre, Larry Byrom, Randy Turner, Terry Young, Dave Olivera, and Ian McDonald, and you can see a clip from one of his concerts at www.tunes.org/joe-bell. Joe has released three CDs, including his most recent and highly successful, &amp;quot;The Rise of the Outlaws,&amp;quot; on WOW Records (www.wowrecords.com). He has an upcoming CD of pop songs, from his song &amp;quot;May I Begin This World with Your Love?&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve Been Serving You at the Table of the Hungry Earth&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Last May, at the annual Friends of the Oregon Folk Music Renaissance convention (http://friendsoforutmusic.com/aboutus), I wrote a heartfelt tribute to the Oregon folk singer/songwriter Mark Ronson (http://www.gofmrend.org). The tribute included a new song that Ronson had written and directed--it&amp;#x27;s featured here. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve Been Serving You at the Table of the Hungry Earth&amp;quot; is a collaboration with the old folksinger Barbara Rose, and is one of the most touching and meaningful pieces of Oregon music ever written. The lyrics, with this story&amp;#x27;s background music, provide the emotional drive of the song.</p>
