This is one of the most popular MMO s in the world and thanks to the developer Wrath of the Lich King there were over 11,000,000 players in the world of Azeroth as far back as 2008. As of 2013 there were over 15 million players and around 130 million gold on the server. This is truly a place for gamers of all walks of life to be able to show their admiration for and appreciation for these 13 legendary houses of Warcraft. Warcraft is a game that everyone can enjoy, it is a game that everyone can start playing if they haven&amp;#x27;t already, and it is also an MMO that changes when you play it to include quests, level up, seasonal quests and even death.

As we saw in Warlords of Draenor a few years back, many of us get bored of the same old gameplay. We yearn for something fresh to explore, for an adventure for our adventurers. We&amp;#x27;ve created a massive database of quests for players to complete and many great achievements to be rewarded. As an MMO, Warcraft also focuses on PvP, PvE activities players can participate in, it really is a true party feel to the game and all of this combined ensures a rich and varied game over the seasons! Once you sign up and you and your friend agree on the start of the game, you will each be given the role and the quest name of the class and person that you will join the guild to do the fight. Each guild is also assigned a region and will have quests with those areas as objectives. There really are a wide range of MMOs to choose from and is bound to appeal to everyone, everyone is different! Then, right before you start the game we go over what to expect, what to expect in what to the typical players do, and you have a choice of when to log-in you are going to be logged into the game!</p>
