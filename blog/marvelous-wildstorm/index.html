<h1>Marvelous Wildstorm</h1>
<p>A few weeks back I suggested a Wildstorm event that would take place on a giant, indestructible island. Fans of Wildstorm books and Star Wars comics have a sense of what could occur this summer, but few of them have thought much about the fate of the universe. Here&amp;#x27;s four weeks worth of thinking. Join me for the wildest, craziest, most thoughtful Wildstorm adventures.</p>
<p>What would happen if Robert E. Howard&amp;#x27;s Western world were merged into our own? And what role would Dune star Dean Cain — whose entire history is written about in his Dune books — play in shaping the wild thing that&amp;#x27;s coming before us?</p>
<p>What about a new all-star stable of heroes who represent the three key themes of Dune — freedom, justice, and balance? How might the universe be better represented if the central characters of the original series are now going to form a wild shape? And what about a new version of the first book&amp;#x27;s War Machine? Why isn&amp;#x27;t it a Big Dune Tank? How does that play into the wild things going on in the Duneworld books?</p>
<p>And what about a new bunch of followers of the holy fire of the Wollies? Are they destined to be the stuff of nightmares?</p>
<p>In short, what would happen if Robert E. Howard&amp;#x27;s Western Wildcat City were merged with our own? And what would be the ultimate fate of that scene-setting Coney Island amusement park?</p>
<p>The Imperial Steel Pot can no longer be manufactured in Arabia. In order to prevent a lethal sabotage that could vaporize the country and destroy the world, the Imperium has decided to pour 20 million imperial units of explosive steel into the city&amp;#x27;s aquifer.</p>
<p>The city is almost entirely under attack and the people living inside what had been the grandest and most famous palace in the world are increasingly uneasy about what the palace establishment might be up to. The secret service is still not convinced that any Imperial operation is taking place, or that anyone, let alone an entire society, wants to see the palace destroyed.</p>
<p>After years of planning, the plan has worked almost totally as designed. Within twenty minutes of its execution, it&amp;#x27;s clear that the imperial city is under attack.</p>
<p>The explosion blows off an entire section of the aquifer, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t really succeed in vaporizing the building, or in blowing the whole thing up.</p>
