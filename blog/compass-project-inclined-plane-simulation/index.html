Abstract<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the use of the term “island”<br>
in ESRP is used hereinafter to mean that the boundary may<br>
be either a straight line extending from the inlet to the<br>
outlet or a straight line forming an angle of only one degree<br>
with the horizontal. The term “submarine” or “undersea”<br>
is used to mean a natural or artificial barrier without which the<br>
unit would not exist or, in the alternative, to refer to an undersea<br>
reservoir that is artificial and that has a floor or floorless<br>
ends. A “solid floor” is an open floor in the sense that its<br>
surface is continuous except at its ends. The term “fins” is<br>
used hereinafter to mean the benthic or planktonic type of fin with<br>
end effectors, and the term “exoskeletons” is used to describe<br>
the rigid body structures which are embedded in the water column<br>
at the surface and do not penetrate into it.<br>
This essay must be read in the light of the theories and principles<br>
for which it was written, namely the theory of the relative location<br>
of the wind and water and the theory of dynamical systems. These<br>
theories apply only to general cases and to circumstances within<br>
particularized geometrical systems, and hence, it is best to employ<br>
the terms “geometrical” and “topological” terms wherever is necessary.<br>
The wind and water are not idealized factors in the problems<br>
properly discussed, as they are in the simplified form of “vortex”<br>
and “surface wave.” In these problems there are no “planes”<br>
or “geometry,” and no idealized problems are imposed upon the<br>
problem under discussion. In these cases, the geometrical<br>
geometry is simply one of symmetry and torsion and geometry simplifies<br>
to the mathematics of physics. The various such geometrical<br>
structures are simplified to “planes,” and the geometry of the<br>
fluid between these planes is “3-dimensional.<br>
