<h1>Melanie Divasta</h1>

<h2>+ Show Spoiler +</h2>

<p>Melanie (R) - 32 point</p>
<p>As a Twitch streamer, Melanie has learned not to mess with the likes of Iso86 and Tzeitel. Her 6th place finish in the World Championship means she’s not a fan of the Top 4 finisher stage anymore, as we didn’t have time to start selecting our top 3, but she’ll still always consider herself the 3rd best player in WCS Global Tour: Brazil 2018. Melanie’s strategy-heavy game play tends to benefit from the ability to adapt to match-ups, however her strategies are as standard as they get and she could have been a little stronger in her 3rd place finish. However, being the best is what matters most to our team!</p>
<h2>Michael “Sakari” Fujioka</h2>
<p>He is a pretty solid player whom I’d personally like to see support the rest of us, but he also comes into this tournament in a group with a higher rated player with many of the same tools, so his place on the current list is up in the air.</p>
<h2>Kalinko</h2>
<p>Kalinko is a consistent player who has been consistently pushing his game throughout the year. Though admittedly it would be a stretch to say I’m pushing his game as much as he’s, I think it’s safe to say that the popularity of Kalinko&amp;#x27;s original team, Origen, is largely responsible for the success of his CS:GO careers.</p>
