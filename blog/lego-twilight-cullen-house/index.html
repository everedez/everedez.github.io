<p>Our property does not contain the main structure and is not likely to be occupied as a residence for any longer duration than 3 months.</p>
<h2>A.3 BEDROOMS &amp;amp; BATHROOM</h2>
<p>This B3 bedroom, open plan is on the first floor in a historic village that is situated on the edge of a state park. As with every room in every room, its natural light is very versatile allowing for the incorporation of an almost unlimited number of wall hangings and decorations. We are looking for a full style interior designer to help us create an attractive living space for our guests.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the back of our building as seen from the front yard. (picture source is the Property Management)</p>
<p>This B3 bedroom is light and bright with a pretty brazilian rose window featuring a view of a greenbelted valley that would make Winnies husband Jay Nelson want to weep with pride.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful formal staircase with floor to ceiling glass skylights coming from the walls that give the room an extra depth of light in the midst of all the beauty. The walls and floor are adorned with the ubiquitous gold filled animal prints. (picture source is the Property Management)</p>
<p>These intricate murals were added during a renovation in 2002. Perhaps an expert eye would spot the patterns. We are open to suggestions about other colors that we might dream up once completed and ready to occupy. (picture source is the Property Management)</p>
<p>There is an open back entry hall to this room that feels like you just stepped out onto a private patio out of a movie with a bottle of champagne chilling in a beautiful vase. An oversized set of french doors keep you in the shade.</p>
<p>There is a good long dining room that features a wood lined bar, but it is at a slight disadvantage as there is a bit of darkness in the way as if something was in the room that just wasn&amp;#x27;t meant to be.</p>
<p>And oh, what a back patio! We asked ourselves then what color we would paint it, our reply came quickly as we knew black or gray would be appreciated as well. Since the patio is not quite large enough this is also a good candidate for extra lighting.</p>
