<h1>Ashamed I Hear My Mocking Voice</h1>
<p>Vasari from the Tales of Symphonia series. He was the closest friend I&amp;#x27;ve had since the episode where we did that battle in the bath house. He had no doubt as a weapon was imminent. Once he started talking about using it he was pretty certain that I wouldn&amp;#x27;t be able to get anything for my life other than a good concussion due to a giant mass of his so I calmed him down with this.</p>
<p>A huge flood of memories (my future). No way that&amp;#x27;s happening, it just isn&amp;#x27;t. Even I can admit that this isn&amp;#x27;t something I&amp;#x27;m willing to go along with. Once it&amp;#x27;s over I&amp;#x27;ll never tell anyone the truth. It&amp;#x27;s too painful and too risky, so I&amp;#x27;ll just keep the truth to myself.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s possible that the real memory of my murder doesn&amp;#x27;t touch me as harshly as the truth does. If it&amp;#x27;s something in my head I&amp;#x27;ll never know what I remember.</p>
<h2>Gruesome.</h2>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m starting to forget I&amp;#x27;m not dead. These memories of blood and horrific trauma, I still sort of remember, but I don&amp;#x27;t enjoy them to the degree that I have before. I had quite a vivid dream that I was being moved into a horrible factory and was to be used in mass experiments for nefarious purposes. We were taken from this place to an occupied part of the world to be experimented on by all kinds of mad scientists. I was tied to some wheel and had a horrible accident where I fell off the wheel. Of course I had my memories I remember some things but everything else is confusing. Anyway, the end of the dream changes my life forever. The factory I was in is now used as a secret prison, used to groom bad men. Yes, it has a name. It&amp;#x27;s called Soultan Industries and the man that built it is known as a Mad Scientist. His name is Commander Vashi, the true heir of Soultan, a legendary evil man who has been murdered with an electronic bomb all over the globe. He could never exist though, because as a mutant they killed him years ago. Well, not nearly a year ago, because he went into hiding some where because he no longer wanted to be the ruler of this wasteland.</p>
