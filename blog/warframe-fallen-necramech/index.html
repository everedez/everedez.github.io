Heaven in the Slaughterhouse<br>
They say that the majority of those hired into Heaven&amp;#x27;s Legion go on to become<br>
the best on the planet. These were the best soldiers that the Legion has ever<br>
seen. They were considered as heroes above who the rest of the soldiery is.<br>
There was a young man, very young, he was a mercenary of the name of Alby.<br>
Well as he was well-known, not many people were aware of him, and even more as<br>
well as him, most people did not know that he was good at killing.<br>
Alby had some other reason why he decided to go away.<br>
One day as Alby was traveling along one of the streets of Prid&amp;#x27;evia, he got<br>
the opportunity to fight on one of the abandoned battlefields. He decided to<br>
take the fight there because he was curious to see if he had the potential to<br>
be a great hero.<br>
Alby is surprised when he sees the scene that was to be fought between that<br>
battlefield on the right and the one on the left. Just as you expected, the<br>
people of both sides were on the lookout for each other. The young Alby<br>
recognized a look of madness in the enemy when they saw the battle taking<br>
place. They did not fight that day to the fullest but only to cover the<br>
opposite side.<br>
Two days later, he enters the same city on the left, but this time he was<br>
injured in fighting before his very eyes. Unfortunately, Alby did not make<br>
any noticeable difference. He saw that the same aura spread to him.<br>
Consequently, the mercenaries rushed to the scene and started to storm the<br>
kill field.<br>
Alby was desperately trying to escape on the one-way streets. The<br>
situation was against him and he could not escape. In desperation he ran<br>
with all his might, but he was unable to fly. Then he fell down from the<br>
fourth floor.<br>
