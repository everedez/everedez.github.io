A street exists near the former Wiradjuri Park to the west of the General Post Office. If this is the same Greer street, then the street formerly known as Parramatta was some 940 metres to the west of the Wiradjuri Park.
If the original Greer street continued to the west of the post office, then the street formerly known as Parramatta would veered to the south and lead to Tunkin and Turramurra.">

<h1>Kingdom Ws Greer</h1>
<p>
Introduction<br>
The place which was formerly known as Parramatta was changed to Greer.<br>
Trivia<br>
</p>
<p>A street exists near the former Wiradjuri Park to the west of the General Post Office. If this is the same Greer street, then the street formerly known as Parramatta was some 940 metres to the west of the Wiradjuri Park.</p>
<p>If the original Greer street continued to the west of the post office, then the street formerly known as Parramatta would veered to the south and lead to Tunkin and Turramurra. It was originally called Cooktown and, from the 1980s until 2007, was known as Boondall. Whilst such would be inaccurate, Boondall is still the suburb which surrounds the Parramatta Catholic College and follows most of the town&amp;#x27;s northern boundary through to Wiradjuri and back to Greer.</p>
<p>Greer was originally a disused railway station and the bridge over the railway line, which enabled the construction of Parramatta Station from 1924, was the only remaining structure from the Great Southland Railway and was demolished in 1983.</p>
<p>A footbridge used by buses links Greer with the following locations:</p>
<p>
Greer Junction and Leckenham<br>
Greer Tunnel and Wyong Hotel<br>
Eastern Transom Depot<br>
Parramatta Road, Tafeerah and Silverwood Cres and Sherrin<br>
Portmore Junction and Sydney Harbour Tunnel<br>
</p>
<p>It is possible that the Parramatta railway bridge, which was the only remaining remnant from the original Wiradjuli railway station, was demolished (presumably due to the need to reestablish a station at Parramatta) before the suburb was sold to the Port, meaning the location of the original Parramatta Station would have remained in the area.</p>
<h2>Transit Street</h2>
<h3>Conversion</h3>
<p>Initially on January 1, 1874, a street numbering system was introduced. It was listed as 13 Street Road, Greer (which was its postcode) in the 1906 edition of the Local Government Gazette: &amp;quot;the street now known as Greer&amp;quot;. This name was transferred to the street in 1912. However, the exact location of the former Parramatta Station still remains unknown.</p>
