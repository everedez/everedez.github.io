<h1>Doreen Moroney Indianapolis</h1>
<p>What is our vision? To provide a luxury sedan like no other. For decades, small luxury vehicles have served as a bridge between mid-price luxury sedans and the larger-engined segment, but they were overshadowed by their luxury competitors. The resurgence of the small luxury is on the cusp of breaking a glass ceiling on the segment. It presents our sales and service team with the opportunity to get into this new business - one that could stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Our luxury divisions are making inroads in segments like SUV and minivan, offering affordable value and versatility over the last few decades. We have a solid talent pipeline and offer the great customer service in the auto industry today.</p>
<p>Our sales approach begins with our focus on value and service at a price that reflects that value. Our vision is to represent the ultimate luxury sedan. Our top down approach includes a customer service and team approach where you can focus on the vehicle’s value over our client’s emotional side.</p>
<p>We work in a culture that promotes solutions and innovation, where our team strives to create a more enjoyable experience for our customers. We continually strive to improve our service organization and the quality of our products and customer experience.</p>
<p>Our team strives to provide a premium experience and values not only our customers’ happiness, but our own. We have a long history of building brand equity in every decision and every step of our journey starting with the customer who owns the car, and then our team. We invest heavily in customer service - the same quality and investment that we bring to the product. We are ambitious about creating a legacy that reflects the unique personality of the sedan we provide everyday. We spend a lot of time with our customers and enjoy customer loyalty. This culture and passion for our customers are worth every penny. We&amp;#x27;re committed to long term business success and are passionate about what we do. We are focused on going all-in on customer value and creating sustainable success.</p>
<p>The car starts with the family in mind, so you’ll find us dedicated to providing the biggest family sedan market in the world, on as popular a road as Florida’s Turnpike Road and Indiana’s Hoosier State Fairgrounds, in exciting and affordable ways. A unique and recognizable luxury image combined with dependability and exceptional value in every segment is our objective.</p>
