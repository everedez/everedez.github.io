Features<br>
An experiment in black box that lets you see what is actually happening on your machine from your computer.<br>
High level API<br>
</p>
<p>Built on top of the std::transform, graph and graph_by_polygon classes for input and output data, showing the type of each graph as its node, the problem and its flow in the problem statement</p>
<h2>Primitives</h2>
<p>Transform, graph and graph_by_polygon operations used to manipulate any object, such as vectors, matrices, points, rectangles and slices</p>
<h2>Graph-Based</h2>
<p>Takes an empty graph that specifies how nodes and connections should be arranged. If the graph is rectangular, the center of rectangles are the nodes (as known from the graphâ€™s edges) and the corners are the nodes connected to the corners. For instances, a rectangle graph has nodes ABCD, where the nodes ABC are connected to ABC and all other neighboring nodes. In the case where corners are the nodes that are not connected to any other node in the graph, their respective node locations are set to be equal to an average of coordinates for the corners.</p>
<h2>Graph:</h2>
<p>center = [A B C]/8 3 : *(AB *(AB+BX/4 + BY))</p>
<p>and corners = [AB *(AB+BX/4 + BY), ACE](AB+BX/4+BY)</p>
<p>As in the examples, shapes in the graph act (at least, from a data source perspective) as points (but may be lines, lines together, lines with sides)</p>
<p>
A full reference implementation of this is here.<br>
Concepts<br>
An algorithm is applied to one or more vectors.<br>
