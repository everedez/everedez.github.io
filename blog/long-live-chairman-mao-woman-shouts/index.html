This is the single biggest lie I heard today, but it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily the most shocking. It is no longer the case that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s largest companies have been on the wrong side of the war on terror, but that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s leaders are still trying to keep that from happening.">

<h1>Long Live Chairman Mao Woman Shouts</h1>
<p>&amp;quot;These people say that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over, that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over, that &amp;quot;small groups only&amp;quot; try to take over; that&amp;#x27;small groups only&amp;#x27; try to take over.&amp;quot; - Mao</p>
<p>This is the single biggest lie I heard today, but it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily the most shocking. It is no longer the case that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s largest companies have been on the wrong side of the war on terror, but that the majority of America&amp;#x27;s leaders are still trying to keep that from happening. Many of the most public figures in America&amp;#x27;s national discourse today have taken part in supporting operations, or support efforts to overthrow those that oppose the government. And as we know, no one ever accused the national president of India of being concerned with the well-being of the vast majority of citizens. The current generation of Democrats in America and most Americans in general have supported and continue to support operations that are in the American interest, like Iran-Contra, the war on drugs, the CIA-backed coup in Chile, the expansion of torture, the WTO, which, of course, leads to the expansion of trade agreements for America&amp;#x27;s corporate interests, which everyone in the media and at the most prominent business schools and universities is trying to think through, like Hong Kong and Kofi Annan and, in general, every concern that America has about China.</p>
<p>And so naturally, they are going to be supportive of the war on terror, like as an extension of the same operations, but now an extension of the same reasons. This is a pattern that is becoming common. I think I&amp;#x27;m probably running into someone else about whom I&amp;#x27;ve heard a lot of the same bullshit, but this is starting to hit me everywhere.</p>
<p>On Russia - there is a very clear, very angry, very clear, very clear, very prominent majority of citizens calling for the military to invade Syria because they were hoping that Trump could knock Russia out of the game, and he hasn&amp;#x27;t.</p>
<p>And guess what? Russia still plays a global role as a system, and Putin still gets lots of support. Putin still gets lots of support and has influence, even as he goes about destroying democracy, as Russia does. He continues to be a bully because people still believe that Russia should have world influence and that Russia is still a valuable foreign threat.</p>
