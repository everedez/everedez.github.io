Mizuno<br>
Mizuno was first<br>
On 16 April 1848, Mizuno was announced as a top-class<br>
sword and lance player of British origin. He was the eldest son<br>
in the Mitsuzawa family that had lived for over a century in<br>
Niigata Prefecture. He was an eminent yōkai artist who painted<br>
drawings of the Kumano dynasty. The Mizuno clan operated a<br>
wealthy trading empire throughout Japan for nearly three<br>
centuries, supplying vital raw materials to the new industrial<br>
era that we know today as the Meiji era. The first generation<br>
Mizuno disciples inherited their father&amp;#x27;s interest in this<br>
game and continued it when he died, forming a clan on the basis<br>
of his first name. The second generation, son of a descendant of<br>
the first generation, joined his father&amp;#x27;s brother. The third<br>
generation began to interest themselves in studying the subject<br>
that became known in Japan as seki yo, whose practitioners were<br>
officially ennobled with the traditional Masamune family title. The<br>
rest of the clan became known for their artistic talent and<br>
philosophical approach. When the Meiji era came, they were still<br>
among the best players in the world.<br>
With the creation of<br>
Mizuno&amp;#x27;s high rank, the clan adopted a new style of fencing<br>
that emphasized attack and defensive action to the extreme. The<br>
Mitsuzawa style reflects the tastes and political concerns of<br>
Japan at the time. The Mizuno style of fencing was originally<br>
based on swords with a bladed tip, but in time it became<br>
associated with light, curved blades. Traditional Japanese<br>
hilarity now focused on creating fun. Professional players spoke<br>
of their use of gels and oils to heighten their skill. Professional<br>
athletes honed their skills in much the same manner, using<br>
conditioner, lubricant, and mouthwash. It was the style that gave<br>
Mizuno his high rank and subsequently that of his samurai disciples.<br>
By the mid-1930&amp;#x27;s, he was<br>
famed in the West for his innovation and control of his game.<br>
