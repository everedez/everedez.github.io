<h1>Evolve Multifunction Showerhead</h1>
<p>Evolve was developed as a water soluble solution to eliminate the need to wash all of your laundry as it is drying in order to avoid cluttering up your lint room.</p>
<p>Evolve is manufactured in a clean room environment reducing the possibility of a chemical and biocides buildup causing your house to smell like an army base.</p>
<p>Since the release of evolve-60, evolve-100, the majority of evolve-full has replaced the traditional laundry solution. In order for users to start integrating evolve into their household, evolve is purchased by the residential home and installed in an upsell to evolve-full.</p>
<p>Now you can easily run a trickle of water through your Evolve Multifunction Showerhead so you don&amp;#x27;t have to use a chemical spray to wash your items down to the fibers.</p>
<p>This powerful showerhead and its two automatic sprayers allow you to run a single stream of water through your Evolve Multifunction showerhead for your wash cycle or multiple sprays for your dry cycle.</p>
<p>It is great for any shower, bathroom, or kitchen!</p>
<p>The 6&amp;quot; square Evolve Multifunction Showerhead with 4&amp;quot; flapper nozzle is a pre-selected thickness solution to minimize the chance of water running onto the fibers of your fabric and causing it to fluff up.</p>
<p>To begin the evolve-multifunction showerhead, install a showerhead into your Evolve showerhead bracket until your showerhead is properly placed. Once the showerhead is correctly oriented to the showerhead bracket, slide it into place.</p>
<p>Use the 4&amp;quot; flapper nozzle with its white cap as soon as possible or wait 24 hrs to have enough time to readjust the nozzle. The liquid coming out of the nozzle is flowing through the chamber of the nozzle and into the body of the showerhead&amp;#x27;s cast aluminum showerhead spout.</p>
<p>If you would like to go through the process of changing from the old showers liquid sprayer, for the hot water, and put down the new Evolve Multifunction Showerhead, theevolve-multifunction shopping guide is a snap for everyone!!</p>
<p>Each cartridge comes with your showerhead at a discounted price, and comes with one or two of the 4&amp;quot; flapper nozzles and this low purchase value is the icing on the cake.</p>
