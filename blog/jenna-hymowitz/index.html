<p>Listen, there are some very hairy things happening in this world.</p>
<p>Do I want to be “famous”? In my class? At parties?</p>
<p>
Handy for having a beer, but not so hard if “famous” means “thoughtful<br>
and justifiable use of your talents as a public servant.”<br>
The thing with #MeToo is that sexual harassment has almost become a<br>
constitutional matter, like the oath of office on the Indiana flag.<br>
Jenna Hymowitz<br>
New York Times July 20, 2018<br>
A recent study reveals some interesting sociological research that<br>
shows that #MeToo is really only about a woman saving a man from<br>
fatalizing himself.<br>
Liked: The research focuses on 4 real men who have been stalked and<br>
their strategies to escape that bad boy for decades. I’m not going to<br>
browsing through it to dig into the real stories or bad boy anecdotes,<br>
but here’s what you can get out of it if you like looking at demographics.<br>
What I did is I’ve transcribed four of the stories, and I then took<br>
those statements and I took away the few that have a definitive,<br>
definitive, word for word statement of lack of empathy and awareness.<br>
Then I took away a number of completely self-serving statements. I<br>
then put a number of statements under a number of heads and put a<br>
number of those in that number of statements.<br>
In this study, there were 197 potential men so I’ve kept them in order to<br>
be able to tell you I was working, but a few things turned up.<br>
Among these seven men were three men who have lived by the motto of<br>
“Don’t let this happen to you.” The following are just a few of the<br>
following, some are original submissions, the names are very private,<br>
but I’m not going there; they won’t be all for public consumption.<br>
