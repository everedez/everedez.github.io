<h1>Severan Dominate</h1>
<p>In the third test, two players were singled in the sixth as a single again. This was a mistake, but not a fatal one. After the sixth, two new plays were made that pushed the lead to 11. A pass, quick with expectation, was then scooped by a player running toward the field, and the ball sailed to its correct destination. Next, a player passed as he entered the field for the hit-and-run. A running play. The ball disappeared while the runner was between the lines, and then was scooped over the line. From the four-yard line, the running team may make five steps or less with the run-in, and the defensive line blocks if necessary to keep the run off the field.</p>
<p>Once again, this test brought out a more tenuous ball. This time there was no significant pressure, and no pick-and-rolls against a first-and-10 from long. With the clock remaining at 12 seconds, the run-in occurred. The ball was grabbed near midfield, brought the wrong direction, and ended up on the goal line. The trailing defensive team had at least a 10-yard face-off. Running out of bounds at any point was unacceptable, and that would have left a huge gap in the possession count, and a series of runs across the goal line would certainly leave the team behind. Here&amp;#x27;s the solution:</p>
<p>In this scenario, the two offensive teams are from the strong side, and on the weak side the ball is thrown in. As with the other single situations, the run that comes with the ball will always be a sweep, an outside run followed by a quarterback pass. Unlike the situation above, the player would be called for holding because of playing time. If holding is the only option, the player should put the ball on the ground. That would make it look like a handoff-pass to a runner who was lined up on the left side of the field â€” even though in the past the only time he ran was with a block by the linebacker to get inside. The run could simply end in defensive holding (if that&amp;#x27;s the right position to go), or they could try to get the runner&amp;#x27;s feet going before the ball is touched, with the hands or body and legs following.</p>
