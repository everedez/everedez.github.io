<p>Also, here are the details for the wedding:</p>
<h2>May 2012</h2>
<p>Upper West Side location - the bride&amp;#x27;s family&amp;#x27;s church (1331 W 47th St) has just been renovated with newly renovated spaces. The space that we found was in a full circle building.</p>

<h3>June 2 - October 12, 2012</h3>
<p>Yes, it was a re-engagement. We moved into the newly renovated church (1331 W 47th St) and quickly moved on to the now renovated space, within the church. We really loved that this newly renovated space is separated into a chapel and reception area. There are three different spaces in the old church that could have been used for our wedding. One is the section for the wedding services, another for the reception and a third private area for the bride and groom. The area outside of the church is for the photographer or rehearsal, so there is no question whether the rooms would be used for a wedding here or there. At this stage, our photographer is located there. Our groom is still living in the church and he will not be going anywhere else. I guess we can only hold our breaths until things get real.</p>

These beautiful ceiling lights change with the color of the room, so I could have decorated very differently.<br>
Our lighting setup was the same as the one featured in the book. What you see here is the space that we found.<br>
My stylist and I found them in June, and put them up in this beautiful space over the summer.<br>
For more information, please feel free to send us an email.<br>

<p>I did have a great time working with Mr. and Mrs. Keith. He has been quiet lately due to family problems but I&amp;#x27;m sure he will be a darling husband. I&amp;#x27;m looking forward to meeting the boys when they arrive.</p>
