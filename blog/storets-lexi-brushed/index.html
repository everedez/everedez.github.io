<h1>Storets Lexi Brushed</h1>
<p>The Lexi® Strawbs is from the best family of K-cup and 60-cans. A superb feature of their wood grain and pattern makes the straw look very special. The straw are strong and handy when cooking and great for boiling eggs and pasta. As described by a Lexi® Member said, &amp;quot;we have been using the Lexi® line for 14 years and am impressed with its durability. The straws are made in Canada using only the finest quality woods and give a great weight and feel to the dryer, which I find very satisfying. We use our dryer to cook and serve eggs and grilled meats at home. They are great on the BBQ and this allows us to have a whole meal together and see how many more meals have been and left to go to the table. My two boys enjoy them making and enjoying meals with us.&amp;quot; The straws by Lexi® are made in Canada for retail sale and imported into Canada by air freight for customers in the UK. They will be dispatched from Canada to address and are insured. They have reached the US as pre-ordered.</p>
