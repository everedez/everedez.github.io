<h1>Doreen Moroney</h1>
<p>A modern-day plucky girl, Doreen Moroney is obsessed with social media and makeup. She loves her twin sister, Tara, the most, and although she is usually more interested in books, she does like to watch thrillers.</p>
<p>Doreen is a normal 17-year-old girl. However, she has been identified as the &amp;#x27;Twin Angel&amp;#x27; by her friends, and she is constantly up to no good.</p>
<p>Doreen&amp;#x27;s love interest is Trevor, a 17 year old male model and travel journalist who is living on the streets of Dublin. He loves sweets and has an extreme interest in cats and curiosities. Doreen is aware that one day she may come across him but stays in contact with him via E-mail</p>
<p>He protects Doreen from harm. And even tells her stories about his life. She replies. He tells her stories.</p>
<p>Doreen is a bad dream. She&amp;#x27;s naughty, and she can be easily provoked. Her temper often gets the better of her. She&amp;#x27;s just a bit dull on the outside, but wicked inside.</p>
<p>Doreen feels like the target of her parents&amp;#x27; overbearing authority. Her friends back them up and they even take her to a psychiatrist, but her sister, Tara, doesn&amp;#x27;t care if Doreen needs a talking to by the authorities.</p>
<p>Doreen&amp;#x27;s mother works a job, but she has a tendency of changing jobs mid-stream. On a good day, she can be this jolly and generous woman. It seems she has no time to worry about the sick, injured and suicidal, because, of course, it is her job.</p>
<p>Doreen&amp;#x27;s father does not look like the right sort of dad... his taste in clothes, his drinking... and, perhaps worst of all, his career. So, this is where he leaves the money, of course, and at his death.</p>
<p>
And her father dies, a terrible event, of heart failure, and out of the blue comes the next one, a death by a water bed.<br>
When a really big job opens up down the road. Doreen&amp;#x27;s flat is at the very bottom of the garden.<br>
Her mother thinks it&amp;#x27;s a boathouse.<br>
Doreen decides to snoop around her flat and discovers one large, rather empty bedroom.<br>
