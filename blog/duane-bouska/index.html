<h3>TWEETS:</h3>
<h3>Tennis Thoughts:</h3>
<p>First, for those who don&amp;#x27;t know, I don&amp;#x27;t like this move and that&amp;#x27;s totally expected. DING BAY should be a lower player, at the very least a five-start guy. Also, looking at the lineup last season, it&amp;#x27;s really not optimal, at all. I love Chris Evert. I prefer his game to what is now around him, but I just can&amp;#x27;t see him averaging 30 against any one player. That&amp;#x27;s just ridiculous. I&amp;#x27;d love to see these guys match up together and I&amp;#x27;m surprised when they get on the court together as there is a great amount of chemistry. It&amp;#x27;s just a complete waste of time. It&amp;#x27;s not even right that the Heat are losing, it&amp;#x27;s completely unfair to start off the season with the numbers that they have. They should be winning; it&amp;#x27;s not because of anyone else, especially Bradley.</p>
<p>I was really disappointed by DING BAY&amp;#x27;s attempt to throw a nut cracker at Rashad Matthews but he looked like such an underachiever this way and doesn&amp;#x27;t have a consistent game outside of the tournament that might be counted as the B-Day party, I still think they have a shot to get it done.</p>
<p>On the USWNT game against Argentina, I believe the defense was just so banged up with injuries, they might just as well have been eliminated. A few errors in the first half from JONATHAN JONES and an important assist by JEREMY MARTINEZ on RYAN TWYMAN&amp;#x27;s goal sealed it. I think that Argentina are by far the best side the US are facing in this World Cup.</p>
<p>Can the U.S. Women&amp;#x27;s Team compete in the World Cup? Yes, for the United States! Yes, for the U.S. Women&amp;#x27;s Soccer team! Time to wake up, wake up, wake up!</p>
<p>I thought that the USWNT was definitely the better team that has had less pressure since the age of 22. That is incredibly boring just to admit publicly though. They must not have that kind of game.</p>
<p>I was really disappointed on the match against Argentina, one of the worst games imaginable. Juan Agudaro went absolutely nuts and put three shots in the nets, the third of which just grazed the top corner and was what kept Argentina scoreless.</p>
