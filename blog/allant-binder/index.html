<p>Pagans, Aleut, and Pueblo Indians have battled constantly, from the days of their being hunted by the Early Chagos (an indigenous race of people originally from the Channel Islands), to Native Americans enslaving, kidnapping, and subjecting, to the American Revolution. The most prominent Native American leadership of Native American religion, United American, who promote the creed that non-Natives deny is a divine order promulgated the words of their Founding Father Thomas Jefferson who stated, “[Natives] were born to be priests, not farmers; but over a century ago, white men thought they were born to be soldiers, not agriculturists.”</p>
<p>In the 17th century the Moravians were the first Orthodox Christian churches to break from their centuries-old traditions and adopt the views of the new monotheistic Christian sect; or, as Benjamin Franklin Jr. called them: “abominable imbeciles.” They broke with their long and rigid adherence to monogenity and assumed the mantle of monastic-caste, the highest of the Orders and Orders of Ascetics who sought only enlightenment through asceticism.</p>
<p>The French, under Colbert’s administrative genius, “were the inventors and the instigators of new religions.” There was a time then when the Puritan’s referred to one and all as “born to be priests”; this was probably referred to under English government as “slavery.” John Milton was in the business at 1609 when a man of such arrogant self-confidence traveled through Massachusetts. Ben Franklin, was the inventor, scientist, and the first teacher from there in every religious order, denomination, and schoolhouse. John Adams, Governor of Massachusetts, having already made known his conversion to the Church of England in 1635, but not yet moved sufficiently to embrace the newly won Holy Spirit, soon after, John Adams became the father of the First Christian war that is now the Second American War of Independence.</p>
