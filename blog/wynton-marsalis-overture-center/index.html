<h1>Wynton Marsalis Overture Center</h1>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The $45 million building was designed by the famous architectural firm of Murphy, Abbot, lotnbrana Architects. It is built with  reinforced concrete and was built by Adolph Coors Company, one of the world&amp;#x27;s largest consumer products companies. In 1937, the new school opened its doors with 200 students and 25 faculty. The students were taught in separate languages and were allowed to make assignments in their own classrooms and at their own pace. The students were taught in French, Spanish and English. In 1943 the school officially became a junior college. During the war, it was considered one of the best facilities of the entire country. Then, in 1964, the school officially moved its operations to the more convenient location of Valley View Community Center, and moved its students with its offices. The name change took place with the completion of the Walter E. Earle Elementary School. It was known as the Wynton Marsalis Academy or the Wynton Marsalis Center for Education. Then, in 1991, the schools further expansion took place. The Walter E. Earle Elementary School was phased out. Then, in 1998, the George M. Matan School of Business, and then finally, in 1999, the Franklin W. Black Academy, were added. In 2005, the Wynton Marsalis Educational Center, was named after Michael Wynton&amp;#x27;s father, Walter Marsalis, known for his work in the early years of the Philadelphia economy in the 21st century. All the schools in the Wynton Marsalis Center come together under one roof and will be known as the Wynton Marsalis Center.</p>
<p>On July 21, 2009, it was announced that students and faculty, organized a &amp;quot;Ivy League Party&amp;quot; on campus. The celebration was held on the first night of the 2009 academic quarter and served as an excuse to bring the campus together, with some student chefs preparing tasty goodies for the party. The theme was French fusion style and was both personal and practical, in the school&amp;#x27;s new library and tutoring center that was built in 2008 and named as one of the best architecture solutions of the 2012 Virginia Architecture and Historic Preservation Awards.</p>
