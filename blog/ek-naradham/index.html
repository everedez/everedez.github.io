<h1>Ek Naradham</h1>
<p>As a traditional method which is little used nowadays, the Sangha consists of close associates. The Sangha is a spiritual organization to support the brothers. There may be several SanhteGI for the same organization. They support each other to develop spiritually through the process of cultivation. They worship the Lord within the circle. The Sangha is not made up of ‘sons’ nor ‘daughters’, but at the centre are the sons and daughters of all the disciples of the Mother Monastery of Sri Bala Basi Ika. Also, the work of the Sangha is to mediate together with the disciples to experience the Dhamma. The Sangha does not strictly follow any particular list of formal rules. It tends to be guided by the questions and answers of the disciples of the Mother Monastery of Sri Bala Ika.</p>
<p>History of the Sangha</p>
<p>The Sangha started in the 13th century when it had 27 monks. By the 12th century, the Sangha numbered 60 monks and 1 nun. Two more nuns joined. The Sangha was under the rule of Sri Bala Basi Ika (the Father Monastery of Sri Bala Basi Ika) and the Mother Monastery of the Mother Mother of the Buddha Dhamma after the 10th century. The monastery came to this the day the Buddhist scriptures were collected by the Buddha himself in the Forest of the Pudgala.</p>
<p>The importance of the Sangha is to invite the disciples to develop spiritually through meditation on the Dhamma. In the 8th year of the MahaSui year (630 CE), there were 20 monks. The last year of the Sangha was in 700, after which the Mother Monastery took over the spiritual leadership and the Sangha from Sri Bala Basi Ika was in the possession of its original number of 60 monks and 4 nuns. But, during the rule of the Mother Monastery, the number of disciples decreased to 17, under the influence of bad behaviour of three monks, four nuns and two disciples, who were expelled the order, out of the number of 42 disciples. The fourth disciple joined the 15th year of the MahaSui year, which was the year that the Buddha himself gathered his old disciples in the four zenanas.</p>
