<h1>Hummingbird Face Mask Feeder</h1>
<p>This is the first picture of a new Mask Face Feeder. As you can see from the pic, the Feeder is built as an upright stand, with a nylon tube coming from the bottom of the structure. The stand allows the person to swivel and move the Feeder from place to place on the face.</p>
<p>The Feeder is made to look more like a swan. By linking the cloth to the mask (in this case to be used as a mask respirator), this Mask Face Feeder project can really come alive for some people by making them feel like they are protecting themselves from a forest of tiny lizards. To date, it is available as a downloadable product. (Buy it here!)</p>
<p>The inspiration for building this Mask Face Feeder came partly from watching a Youtube video on How to make a Mummy Mask. It consisted of the use of both eyelids as a mask and the mask&amp;#x27;s plastic mouth being lifted off the surface of the mask body. This idea was transferred from the Mummy Mask project. From there, the intention was added to the current idea of two plastic boxes. The plastic boxes would hold the plastic strips to allow the plastic mask material to flow around the face, meaning the Mask Face Feeder could swing in a full circle, at least while it protects against it getting damaged, and holding up the eyes while swiveling.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the parts of the Mask Face Feeder came from the Mummy Mask project. This set-up is just a simple setup on a 3ft plastic board which could be put together in a couple of seconds. A screw that fits the front of the mauve mask is used to hold it together. Two pieces of cardboard are stuck on to the front of the mask body so they are in the same plane and thus stable. To remove it one would need to unscrew both pieces of cardboard slightly, as once unscrewed the mask would tip. By attaching this mask to a lower section of the set-up, it would attach to the front.</p>
<p>This Mummy Mask setup has more than just eyes covered. From this, one can imagine that the mask can now cover the mouth and nose, and hide your eyes. The holes for the mask&amp;#x27;s plastic mouth could also be put together on the surface of the mask body and that together create a waterproof mask.</p>
