<h1>Ari Ptacek Obituary</h1>
<p>I started dancing when I was 5 years old. Then when I was 11 I began taking the clarinet, bassinet and guitar lessons I was given in school. Then, after high school, I moved to Berkley, CA for 9 straight years!</p>
<p>My first song was an unknown (if I remember correctly) by Chicago, IL songwriter &amp;quot;RJ&amp;quot; called &amp;quot;Turn Me Round.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>I used to ride my bike all over that area during summers until I got too old and sickly to keep going, and eventually gave it up in favor of working on my music in the evenings. I took a few years off from working and was miserable. I worked at a laundromat for several months (off and on in the middle of the night while still trying to write my first song when the real world showed up). I went through a lot of big life changes and I wondered if what I was doing and living for was even real. I tried to break down into writing songs to God&amp;#x27;s guidance and to get some relief from the daily rigors of being on the road all day and trying to make it to set ends meet. I thought that maybe I was just lonely and in a rut because of all of that frustration; but no matter how angry I got from my seemingly godless position as a hard street singer, I always knew that I was doing this because of a desire to make a difference, and not because any particular god seemed to care at all. It was in those moments when I felt most alone that I needed help and found my voice - it sounds crazy but it was the best thing I have ever experienced.</p>
<p>I sang back in the small church where I grew up in the Chicago area, and worked my way up the power and voice to the point where I was in a wedding benefit. I always loved performing, so meeting people on the street was fun. A friend said the girls liked me too because I could joke.</p>
<p>While in Philly I did a little studio time to learn on my own. After a few years with that (I think I was 24) I decided it would be good to record an album, and the concept was to learn the melodies on my own and then record them into a song that people could buy. After lots of working with different people, the songs were pretty well on their way when the song was interrupted by the good news.</p>
