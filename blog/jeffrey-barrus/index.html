<p>It&amp;#x27;s official. One of entertainment network TBS&amp;#x27; programming may have placed an upset on the food show front with this week&amp;#x27;s BOLDLY GO with MAGIC — Celebrity Cooking Showdown. TBS&amp;#x27; YouTube channel announced it is giving the a primetime night spot to the 2018 Black Magic Spectacular Food Show: Black Magic, one of the oldest magic shows in America.</p>
<p>
Boldly Go with Magic: Valerie Bertinelli<br>
Time: 05/19/2016<br>
Saturday Night Live (SNL)<br>
</p>
<p>Beneath the surface of what is probably one of the most popular entertainment (and, in the end, life&amp;#x27;s greatest discovery) on television is just below the surface of entertaining. Tonight&amp;#x27;s episode marked the 100th episode of SNL as well as the 90th single-season episode for NBC. The show is a midseason staple not only to fans but also to the producers of the show. With most of the plot lines revolving around the comedy team of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, the latest show certainly had some serious entertainment to give us.</p>
<p>
Boldly Go with Magic: Jen Kirkman<br>
Time: 10/18/2015<br>
KINTV<br>
Olivia Pope<br>
</p>
<p>Of course, there was some talk of a plot involving Jenna (Mara Wilson) as well, but it was too early to go that road. And, in fact, given how rarely the focus goes on Olivia Pope, it was hard to find just what had transpired with her here. What&amp;#x27;s particularly tough since there had been a lot of discussion about the supposed lesbian power struggle between her and Adam Sandler, he was at one point deemed as having the prerogative to make Olivia the one who wins.</p>
