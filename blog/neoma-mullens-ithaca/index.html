<h1>Neoma Mullens Ithaca</h1>
<p>He is a member of the class of 1973 and of the American Sign Language at Wesley Prep School.</p>
<p>He is the son of Nancy and Malcolm Mullens of Ithaca, NY.</p>
<p>Since October, 1965, Minnie Mullens has been involved with a program to provide a setting for teenaged deaf youth to develop special skills that will assist them in many aspects of their life. She works with these youths from age fourteen to seventeen so that they may become productive members of society. (Source: [http://www.iht.com/1994/06/13/delores-mullens.html)]</p>
<p>Delores, as she is known, has spent many years as a dedicated advocate for the needs of deaf and hard of hearing youth. With her husband, Malcolm Mullens, she raises four daughters, Karen, Jennifer, Pauline, and Robin. Delores retired from the New York State Education Department as Department Manager of a statewide program for developmentally disabled students with mental retardation, and through her years of dedicated work for the welfare of the disabled, she has won recognition and awards for having made a lasting impact on society.</p>
<p>She was honored in April, 1999, for the opening and closing of the New York State Ministry for the Deaf.</p>

<p>Earlier, the Mullens had established the Sign Language Center at their property in Ithaca.</p>
<p>Dr. John Baker and Dr. Peter N. Noakes, the architects of Ithaca’s first (and still current) publicly funded primary and secondary school, have led Ithaca’s move into its third decade of existence through significant achievements in the fields of early education, health education, extracurriculars, counseling, K-12 teaching, and curriculum innovation.</p>
