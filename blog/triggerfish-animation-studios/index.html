As well, some poor guy had been doing some fairly exact pictures of the positions himself. It was during this period that I first noticed about the design and conception of these fictional characters; but having then a large amount to analyse, it was an exciting experience.</p>
<p>There was an initial thread in the forum entitled &amp;#x27;We are a good design team&amp;#x27;; it got down so many designs for these characters that I will give the summary here.</p>
<p>Of course they are not real, they do not have feet, lungs, arms or faces, they are just created as I have found the picture I liked in the textbooks I have studied.</p>
<p>The idea is to do the game in a really large font, made in a very special, low-resolution font such that it retains its size. The colours are very bright and easy to read, and the letters could not be mistaken for any other actual thing.</p>
<p>To say I have been working on these for some more than a year is an exaggeration, since my first submission did not get any replies to my submissions; which came within 5 days to be noted. When the page was created and I had almost 100% of the symbols finally done, I filled the site with the images already done.</p>
