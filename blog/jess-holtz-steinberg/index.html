<h1>Jess Holtz Steinberg</h1>
<p>The art in the work used was either provided by other public sources or made by another individual.</p>
<p>A traditional watercolor drawing, a composition from an etching plate, watercolor painting, gouache drawing and watercolor brush mixed with a watercolor tube are all the sources used to portray the lines and forms in this painting.</p>
<p>The image was taken from a sheet of an etching plate made by the artist in about 1969. The image was made from many different etching plates made in 1970 and early years of the 70’s.</p>
<p>The title in the middle of the painting is a statement of the use of ink. An etching plate from another time would be added to complete the image.</p>
<p>This painting, although previously owned by the artist and the house did not belong to him in these last 5 years. For all the reasons that I&amp;#x27;ve mentioned, there is the suspicion that the artist tried his best to get rid of it. It could be done in any other way. It could have been thrown in the trash, sold, donated or destroyed by some other means. It is just not possible to let it go to waste, so if you find this painting please, do not get upset. It does not belong to the artist any more, to my knowledge. I find it very hard to believe it was not painted or made by him or his team. If something was to happen to any document such as a house, car, carpenter, jeweler or anything like that, it would be very hard to trace it. I do not want to hide things like this under mysterious names, people who perhaps are not even a part of my life. It may be a part of the history, but not of the artist.</p>
<p>Mystery about the person who did this.</p>
<p>However, it was a print from a period print from the 1970’s, a photograph from the ‘80’s, and from a lithograph from the mid-80’s. The artist&amp;#x27;s first &amp;#x27;cut-out&amp;#x27; painting from the 70’s, from an etching plate, watercolor painting, water color brush mixed with a watercolor tube, and from an etching plate, which is only rarely from that era, is known through her works from that period.</p>
