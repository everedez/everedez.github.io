How many young girls have been turned into mere queens and royalty in her village?

<p>Nanaka Shina Kanojia was the first princess to live in a huge palace in Nanakkapuram. She was later abandoned and poisoned by her own mother. How many young girls have been turned into mere queens and royalty in her village? Read this story to know about the life of this beautiful and mysterious princess and the horrific family from our very own country.</p>
<p>We recently launched our campaign on a sensitive topic which was of great importance to the communities that need it and which came across as unthinkably dangerous. To survive the onslaught of widespread allegations from the Indian government these communities came to us to serve their mothers. As the first of their kind in India, we worked in partnership with the Unani medical system to provide free medical assistance to destitute mothers, children, families, and nursing mothers. The first 7 babies we provided through the program were the first to leave our care and have been with unañas for the better part of a year now. Each one has grown into a responsible and strong mother with the support of families and unañas.</p>
<p>Our entire team of physicians and social workers have been getting more and more concerned about the impact of the campaign. Their actions have certainly made the fight for our campaign more meaningful. They are braving their own social networks in their own homes and communities to help us spread the messages of sanity through their schools and communities. We pray that it will stay that way!</p>
<p>We created the campaign to help raise consciousness of Unaña parents so it could become more easily accessible all over the country. The most recent information comes from the Dr. Jony Selfer report. It also highlights the fact that the government’s concerns about so-called diseases of the mind or mental faculties have led India into the same dark path as Pakistan.</p>
<p>The consequences for our children are extraordinary and serious. The potential toll this campaign would cause for those providing moral support for our children is likely much greater.</p>
