<h1>Stone Lanterns Ek Balam Forza Horizon 5</h1>
<p>This time you can choose from five different lanterns: Choc Car, Seascape, Seascape 7, Hallaball, and All Soul Eunuch!</p>
<p>Whether you want them all or simply a few of the ones you collect, everything else is also pretty easy. Each lantern comes with a custom print, so you can choose a different color for the lantern if you like! These can all be built using the M.J. Custom Builder. There are also some options for you to make a button lantern to display a single flashlight.</p>
<p>Once you build it yourself, you can personalize the light with a name, face, and even a nameplate.</p>
<p>Well, this time we needed to pick a different locket as the last one was in there long gone. I decided on Shifter Locket. It might not look like the most original item in our show, but it is really well made and works very well. I am even including a sheet of paper with a blue print for better contrast.</p>
<p>This locket is made from a very very very smooth brass. It is very plain except for the shape of the shulchan that resembles the shulchan you are usually wearing! It&amp;#x27;s rather uncomfortable to wear, but I guess it is necessary to keep it looking nice (or comfortable) for our show!</p>
<p>Finally we have a simple option for the M.J. Custom Builders! Remember that you can continue to make parts by hand, or you can also choose to make some option, such as: chest, hands, tail, and head!</p>
<p>The custom part that we have up to this point is a circular plate.</p>
<p>We have been using the plate together with a piece of blue paper, which was able to make the plate look a lot more finished!</p>
<p>I hope you like what we have done with this locket. Share with your friends with a picture of your custom locket! We are also still working on the locket bell!</p>
<p>Now let’s talk a little further. The show will follow your directions, and not any person unless you tell us ahead of time and also with the locket to be sure!</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing: Lockets! Don’t forget to pick up some spare lockets.</p>
