On a map drawn in August 1920, close to the Røros Brewery (in black) in Røros, the city of Copenhagen sits on the southernmost point of Norway. The map includes a sharp bend (running from east to west) which runs parallel to the coast through the far north of Copenhagen. In the spring of 1920 the peninsula of Korsør (or Cape Korsør on the map of Copenhagen) was founded there.">

<p>On a map drawn in August 1920, close to the Røros Brewery (in black) in Røros, the city of Copenhagen sits on the southernmost point of Norway. The map includes a sharp bend (running from east to west) which runs parallel to the coast through the far north of Copenhagen. In the spring of 1920 the peninsula of Korsør (or Cape Korsør on the map of Copenhagen) was founded there. The peninsula is on the southern side of the port of Korsør and can be seen along the Røros River, on the opposite side from the south coast from the Korsør peninsula. The distance from sea to sea is 480 kilometres and the land area is 530 square kilometres. The main economic purpose is fishing; however the southern part can be used for building. The peninsula is divided into Korsør Mainstien (Korsør Harbour), i.e. part of the Korsør Mainstien, which stretches from Korsør Mainstien to the island of Vollendorf, which is used for housing. In the north of Korsør Mainstien (western part of Korsør and lying close to Cape Korsør) there are administrative buildings, such as a central government building and municipal buildings, the old Storting, a combination of the old city hall and municipal home. There is a large hotel here, which can accommodate up to 2000 guests and it is divided into one hotel building, two blocks of four buildings. It is the second largest building in Korsør Mainstien, which, as well as the municipality, contains the national library. The public telephones are in the Municipal building (Borgerhytte) and there is also the municipal swimming pool and green area, which is given the name &amp;quot;Tavlejodet&amp;quot; (loan pools). The chief town or cap, the western part of Korsør Mainstien, is the island of Falchets, which has the Ypen town hall and a municipal theatre, which contains up to 300 seats.</p>
<p>The southern part of Korsør Mainstien can be used for secondary educational facilities. Some of these have small private residence (student rooms).</p>
