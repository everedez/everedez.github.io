<p>The Beginning of the End: Part 2</p>
<p>RIVER BOOKSELLER: How would you describe your read? Have you ever bought a book after its first chapter and liked it? [L:</p>
<p>RIVER: When I get a book that seems worthwhile and it’s got a little something I didn’t quite get. And I want a second chance to love it and wonder what I’d done wrong (or couldn’t do). I guess if I had something I didn’t enjoy just because it was something I didn’t agree with, my reading wouldn’t go too far either! It all comes down to there isn’t too much I care about. And, if you show it through some pretty eyes, it certainly helps! I’m finding some that work and some that don’t really work. If I still like it, I’d probably buy the book to see what I got wrong or not get all the way there!</p>
<p>RIVER: I first got my attention to a Robert Louis Stevenson book, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. I remember when I got my first novel out of the mail, I was completely blown away. I figured this would be just the second or third book out of my family’s record. I bought it. I was amazed that when I got to the end, the last character still in the book was Mrs. Bates because I’d been reading that series for years. I could tell this story straight off. I thought Robert Louis Stevenson was my kind of guy. He had an interesting style of storytelling and it fit in with the stories within the book. I was touched and delighted, and that this book was a hoot to read.</p>
