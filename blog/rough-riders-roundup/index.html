<h1>Rough Riders Roundup</h1>
<h3>[ 1 ] On the Set:</h3>
<p>The crew of The Rough Riders will continue work on the film for at least six months, working multiple camera angles and talking to as many of the kids and other street professionals as they can find.</p>
<p>After a bit of screening and interviews with the kids (and crew), the film will be color corrected and adjusted for a visual aesthetic to reduce the raw footage to what the kids are comfortable with. Next week we will likely be showing that before its initial release into cinemas.</p>
<h2>[ 2 ] On the Set:</h2>
<p>The crew have so far only been able to talk to the group of kids they were filming with. The &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; of the whole operation, DJ, has been interviewed by the crew and had even less to contribute to their project.</p>
<p>The project started about two weeks ago, working on multiple camera angles and even taking them to certain kids to get more involved in the &amp;quot;world&amp;quot; the film was filmed in. To start the campaign, we rented some live action footage shot in the film, but it was released to the public before its completion. To do any comparisons to the finished product, the video will be color corrected as well as made into a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; version.</p>
<p>The full operation is more or less the same. Film and cinematography assistants put their hands on all shots in order to make sure and to make the footage look more consistent throughout the entire operation. When the operation is complete the footage is color corrected and edited again, then the work goes into the video being worked on.</p>
<p>[ 3 ] Filming, Filming and more Filming:</p>
<p>So far, we have only been filming in the locations of the kids&amp;#x27;s homes. After shooting the scenes we will make more edits, color correct the filmed footage and then make two live-action videos. The second video will have full-body live action.</p>
<p>There are also still school options available for the film in Arizona at the local schools. Filming our own schedule for the day, in Arizona, and meeting with the kids as we transition from shooting with the kids and for a few stretches of time. There are some locations that are more suitable for some more school-focused locations however, the school option is almost entirely off the table with the most likely locations being children.</p>
