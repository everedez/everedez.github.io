<h1>Wegmans Johnson City Protest</h1>
<p>
Women and children waiting in line for food, and to also purchase medical supplies.<br>
&amp;quot;The state of Michigan, and in particular, the state of Michigan<br>
Pam&amp;#x27;bob County, M. T., refused to continue the Flint Water Crisis,<br>
which endangered the life and health of thousands of Michigan<br>
citizens and cost the state of Michigan millions of<br>
dollars. Yet, this morning during the scheduled<br>
Water Shut-Off Event, our own local health associations, the<br>
Michigan State Association of Health Plans and<br>
Medical Organizations, together with all of your<br>
members/members-e-o/ from across the MSAOFMHOs throughout<br>
the state of Michigan, have decided to protest the<br>
Scheduled Water Shut-Off Event and<br>
the practice of the state of Michigan, as it may violate<br>
its Constitutional rights, to free speech and assembly, the<br>
right to assemble peaceably without a permit, and to<br>
preserve and protect the integrity and the rights of the<br>
Health Associations through fair, open, and fair election<br>
opportunities. Health Associations across the state of<br>
Michigan recognize the right of peoples’ bodies to<br>
participate in their democratic self-determination, as<br>
being fundamental to their peaceful selfhood. Here in the<br>
state of Michigan, Health Associations are directly<br>
involved with the best interests of their members and<br>
members-e-o/ and constituents.<br>
“They’re not<br>
going to make us suffer”, said one Health Association<br>
member/member-e-o/ in a press conference at the Health<br>
Association of Our State of Michigan Building, to which<br>
hundreds and dozens of Health Associations<br>
participated. “We know how to represent ourselves and<br>
ourselves well, because we’re from other states and<br>
countries.<br>
