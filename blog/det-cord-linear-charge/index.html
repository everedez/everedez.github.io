<h1>Det Cord Linear Charge</h1>
<p>1. Apply a layer of Paint Distressed to the back of the surface and stroke it.<br>
2. Then apply a layer of Paint Distressed over that entire area so that your design will stand out. Be sure to leave it alone for the initial application of paint, as you do not want that color to mix in with any other color. Repeat this process for any other spots where the piece might end up, then apply a coat of Distressed Chalkboard.<br>
3. Then paint the edges black.<br>

<h2>###### Example</h2>
<p>There are pros and cons to paint, as it would be better to be used in moderation and only if deemed necessary for a piece. You can find tutorials on YouTube that can help you understand the capabilities of painting.</p>
<p>## Taking a look at wood movement</p>
<p>The other component of using a canvas is the&amp;#x27;staging&amp;#x27; of the piece. By using canvas first and then treating it to specific and heavy touch, you can achieve a smooth, shiny look. The trick to achieve this is to allow the surface of canvas to show. As it is called, the canvas is just a background, and any imperfections in it like marks and scratches will make an article look dull. To accomplish this you are going to stop painting the surface of the canvas but to get in the smooth, grainy look you are going to move about the piece to get rid of it. It is a good idea to move the canvas around a bit to smooth out any rough or uneven joints that you might have noticed during construction. You can also flatten the canvas if you are able to. Keep the painting as flat as possible. Remember that the painting should give off a smooth feeling and seem to move with the ground below it. This means that the canvas should flex even during the painting process itself.</p>
<p>Another way of using canvas is to make holes in the canvas as well. You should mark out how you want your canvas to look like. Using the center plane, make a straight line from the point you desire, but instead of using a straight line, draw a curve. Using the center plane, draw a circle. Paint a cross-hatch across the circle. This will allow you to show the natural material of the canvas.</p>
