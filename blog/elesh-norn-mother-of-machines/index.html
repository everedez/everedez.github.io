Abilities<br>
</p>
<p>His spells are very magical in comparison with his original power. He can call forth flames in his veins with his breath of life attack, fire wreathes with his spell, and can use his skills in fire immunity. He does not require the armor spells to damage the environment, just the spell attacks he could use. He uses the blood shield spell to protect his land and his water element is protected from his fire energy attacks.</p>
