<h1>Punkrobot Animation</h1>
<p>This is a project to create as much of the Punkrobot assets as possible. The goal is to get a living wall of robots working and displaying some kind of energy or structure on the background or in the foreground. And if I can, I&amp;#x27;d like it to work in such a way that each of the robots have different parts, such as arms and legs or wheels.</p>
<p>Some bits are mainly based on the existing Punkrobot assets but everything is in it&amp;#x27;s own repository: https://github.com/Punkrobot-labs/Punkrobot-Animation</p>
<p>
Punkrobot robot components and programming<br>
You can find more information about these components on an ongoing development blog: http://punkrobotblog.com/home<br>
Requirements<br>
</p>
<p>Looking through the comments and FAQs at http://www.punkrobotblog.com they mention that one of the points of the team was getting &amp;quot;flexible,&amp;quot; so I am including that here for the sake of making the best out of what is already there.</p>
<p>The robots themselves can&amp;#x27;t do much if you walk right at them, so they can only be attacked by a cross-body melee weapon. Even that is limited by the size of the robots armature, so for the most part the weapons are based on paddles (this will change when I&amp;#x27;m done writing the code), pneumatic actuators, or electric motors.</p>
<p>Most likely they will be controllable via analogue devices, such as keyboards, gamepad, or Arduino boards. I would have liked an interactive development environment so that we could do anything with them, as a personal goal, but it&amp;#x27;s hard at this point.</p>
<p>But enough of the basics. This is a project in progress anyway, so there might be more there to get it to play in real-time.</p>
<p>
So what do we need?<br>
So let&amp;#x27;s start by answering just those questions.<br>
What does &amp;quot;kind of&amp;quot; mean?<br>
</p>
<p>It is commonly known that a robot can be made out of just about anything (so if there is any kind of &amp;quot;cheating&amp;quot; involved in the project...). In the case of Punkrobot, what we must have is just enough stuff to build some robots. Think about it, a robot is a &amp;quot;big cephalopod with legs.</p>
