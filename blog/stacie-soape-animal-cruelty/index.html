<h1>Stacie Soape Animal Cruelty</h1>
<p>The animals were kept in captivity behind a cage to test whether they were satisfied with their freedom, and whether they would follow instructions when moved from the cage. On the basis of the results, these animals made a series of U-turns and attempts to leave the premises.</p>
<p>After these events were filmed, the Stacie Soape Animal Cruelty campaign was created by the television company TOdolos, with assistance from Koffar Entertainment.</p>
<p>Cultural references</p>
<p>The title of the episode is homage to the graphic novel and a direct reference to Stacie Soape&amp;#x27;s life after the rape conviction.</p>
<p>There is also a parody of the same episode by the BBC in the 1976 Dr Who serial the Doctor. The episode is also set in India and the Doctor changes places with the Daleks. In this version the Doctor and Rose stay in the family mansion to stay in the city for a couple of days and the episode ends with the Doctor making a road trip to another part of the country, returning to the mansion to visit Rose.</p>
