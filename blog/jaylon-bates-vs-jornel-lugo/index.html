<h1>Jaylon Bates Vs Jornel Lugo</h1>
<p>
How would you describe your height?<br>
55 inches<br>
Did your mother teach you how to run?<br>
My mom and dad are the ones who decided I should practice medicine when I was 9. They left the world of medicine to me.<br>
Did you have friends as a child?<br>
</p>
<p>I did have some friends a year ago when it started snowing. Unfortunately, I have to say that most of my time was spent playing in my neighborhood.</p>
<p>
Boys And Girls &amp;#x27;R&amp;#x27; Us<br>
Do you have a favorite TV show?<br>
X-Factor<br>
If I weren&amp;#x27;t such a good kisser, one would probably call me &amp;quot;Maybelline.&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>In fact, I&amp;#x27;ve spent countless hours in front of a mirror admiring myself, as if wearing just my favorite pair of lipstick does any good.</p>
<p>
I looked into a mirror that I wouldn&amp;#x27;t post here, and, sure enough, I was stunning.<br>
I could not possibly look any better.<br>
Is this a dream for you?<br>
Yes; I hope it is for you.<br>
Any advice for future stars?<br>
The main thing is to think happy thoughts and show it through your actions.<br>
There&amp;#x27;s a lot of young people these days who treat themselves extremely well, and they deserve so much better treatment.<br>
Life is not fair to those who have all they can hope for. (Source: HBO)<br>
</p>
<h2>My World, So Far:</h2>
<p>
My kids have been together for 5 years.<br>
I have 4 kids to raise, half of them are older than me.<br>
How many of your family members are with you right now?<br>
I have 8 people (not counting my parents) that are there at a given moment I guess.<br>
What is your favorite TV show?<br>
House, T.V., The New Adventures of Batman, shows like The Normal Heart, and the whole history of My Fair Lady.<br>
</p>
<p>I like comedies such as Veep, Shakes, All About Eve, and Friends. I also like Dr. Who.</p>
