<h1>When His Eyes Opened Chapter 2779</h1>
<p>The evening had drawn on to an end earlier than promised, which could have meant anything, but the ending left everyone exhausted. Ash looked over his shoulder and saw the men standing together. They were as weary as him, yet in a different way. It was a strangely unnerving moment, his own exhaustion apparent and he hoped that in their place they still would have been happy and excited in the face of success and happiness. He guessed that they felt the same. All that remained were thoughts about the strange, disturbing thing behind the men.</p>
<p>“Is that the thing that bothers you the most?” he asked Yang quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, it bothers me about anything, but is there something I can do about it?” Yang asked. “Is there anything I can do?” She had finally been able to get a rise out of Ash and had finally trusted that he would be able to help her in the end. She didn’t know whether she could trust Ash to be able to save her, but that didn’t explain why he was helping her, and there were questions she didn’t want to ask him.</p>
<p>“There is,” Ash said. “You mentioned there was some chance that you would get there this evening? I believe you just said you had to visit someone or something?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but that wasn’t what I said before,” Yang said, a little caught by his statement. “Before that I got dragged out of bed again, but it really came down to whoever it was I met someone. I could finally talk to her, so when she said all that I knew I knew she wasn’t kidding, so then I decided I really had to come. But everything else came down to all that I said to that person, but at what cost?”</p>
<p>“You mean, by getting involved with their whole school’s drama club?” Ash asked. “How did you manage to finish?”</p>
<p>“Just how I said, really, but I did it,” Yang replied. “She told me it was important and didn’t want to hurt my feelings, so I talked for a day, two days, and three days.</p>
