<h3>The Old Globe Theatre (NY)</h3>

<h2>Charles Kemble Playhouse (Vermont)</h2>
<p>A true favorite, Charles Kemble’s magnificent stage productions and musical numbers are a blend of wit, charm and deadpan humor. His productions run the gamut from vaudeville gags to dramatic interludes. Themes of musical comedy, cross-dressing, lust and alienation, character study — yes, all here. The Charles Kemble Company’s annual production of Jitterbug Performs: A Comedy of Musical Theater is scheduled for Wednesday at the Charles Kemble Playhouse!

<h2>Charles Kemble Playhouse (Vermont)</h2>
<p>Tee Lautua’s “Jitterbug Performs” follows the lives of a fictional group of New Zealand teenagers in the 90’s. I created my “Jitterbug Performs” video for The New Zealand Daily Star and I’m delighted so many New Zealanders thought it was a wonderful way to get “extra” Aotearoa’s best talent on our screens. You can see The New Zealand Daily Star’s fantastic video and tell me in an email why you liked it!</p>
