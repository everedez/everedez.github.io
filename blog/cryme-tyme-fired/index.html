<h1>Cryme Tyme Fired</h1>
<p>One year + 16 years in the making, Chris McCreery revisits his new band, Flyme Tyme Fired, to detail his time at the American Meat Drum and get into what he has planned for Flyme Tyme Fired’s third record called, “The Flyme Tyme I Lost.”</p>
<p>In case any of this makes you question a little about how good an interview with Chris McCreery has gotten, let me assure you that this interview is not for the faint of heart. That being said, Chris makes a pretty decent effort in front of the camera to make it through this interview with far more time than I invested in his previous interviews, at least compared to the time I spent with him while writing this article.</p>
<p>Chris is one of those artists that is there to do the interview and not the art. It makes you wonder what a band of that caliber can actually come up with, before going into the studio. That said, I got very comfortable during the interviews with Chris with that we always got to talk about the creative process, how he approaches it and what moves him as an artist.</p>
<p>Not that I am or have ever been the biggest fan of Chris’ music (Although there is nothing like a CD of Chris’ music on my iTunes or itunes or whatever CD site you choose to download his music on), but most of these interview and discography pieces were written prior to The Flyme Tyme Fired’s creation. So I’m very glad that Chris took the idea and went in and started writing songs. All I was left wanting for the music from The Flyme Tyme Fired is to listen more to their music. That’s it. Just a little something else. It still isn’t much but at least you can at least hear his songs now.</p>
<p>That being said, after the “Fired” music was finished I got interested in what Chris had planned in regards to making the next album. So I went in and said “Hey Chris, what is your next album going to be about?” “Well, the new album is going to be about a guy who lost a lot of stuff. Like everything in life, they will only make one album. And we’re going to use that album as a record.</p>
