<h1>Lindsey Funeral Home Obits</h1>
<p>We can&amp;#x27;t tell you much more other than that it&amp;#x27;s all over. A sad day for anyone ever looked up at! I&amp;#x27;m writing this with a heavy heart, and I hope you think so too.</p>
<p>But after hearing what you have been through, I have to be honest and say that life gets rather lonely at the funeral home. We are always seen in the lobby or being interviewed by the public. Even though our service seems very beautiful, the public know nothing. It&amp;#x27;s a constant challenge to tell someone how many years we have been here and where we are situated, how everyone thinks of us, and just ask &amp;quot;Was it worth it?&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Just this morning, my dad was getting ready to open his home for a Sunday services - things were pretty quiet in the lobby - so I made a quick phone call and told my boss that I didn&amp;#x27;t know anyone to go to and ask if he wanted to start his funeral program. My boss was so glad to hear that and said it was because of all the services that he now loves to have. As I have been the marketing director of the location for the past 5 years, that was not an easy decision. I will be leaving a home that I have gotten along quite well with as it grows together too. I don&amp;#x27;t want to change the world in the way that those so-called &amp;quot;MARKED FOR CHARACTER&amp;quot; for other homes - I try to instill a legacy of family of service to the community here.</p>
<p>For the past four months, my husband is undergoing very intense medical treatment. I feel this transition will be very hard for him and I pray that he won&amp;#x27;t get too numb and not do what he loves - going to church or seeing friends and family. I can only imagine how hard it&amp;#x27;ll be for him. The nursing staff are so compassionate and support the family from the moment they open the door. My family and I have walked in the door before and before they began, my mom&amp;#x27;s cancer was front and center in the household, she looked tired from all the excitement and wondered if it would last much longer, and so we kept coming through the doors.</p>
