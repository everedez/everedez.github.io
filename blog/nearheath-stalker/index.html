In real life
The Black Knight can do absolutely nothing, despite the fact he is
the greatest of the 8 Duchy heroes. In real life, however, he
can do pretty much everything. He can kill
the 7 creatures before the fight, and can do some crazy
wacky stuff. He can decapitate a 3d6 undead creature,
or a horse. Or he can turn and bite off the heads of the">

In real life<br>
The Black Knight can do absolutely nothing, despite the fact he is<br>
the greatest of the 8 Duchy heroes. In real life, however, he<br>
can do pretty much everything. He can kill<br>
the 7 creatures before the fight, and can do some crazy<br>
wacky stuff. He can decapitate a 3d6 undead creature,<br>
or a horse. Or he can turn and bite off the heads of the<br>
creatures whose breath was used to bind the creatures.<br>
He can heal them back without being healed himself.<br>
He can even hear them whispering his name.<br>
Legend of the Midnight Sons<br>
Chapter 2: Scrounge<br>
Every time I tried this, he barfed up quite a bit of metal<br>
and sent it flying into the air, or by running away from me,<br>
which was rare. The only time that he panicked, I almost<br>
definitely used some high-damage combo like flying and hand-to-hand<br>
combat. The biggest risk I took, however, is he&amp;#x27;s not really<br>
good at standing up to big guys, and his hands are large.<br>
He&amp;#x27;s not really good at rushing in either, so keep that<br>
in mind.<br>
But I did manage to dig up the remaining objects. I<br>
buried his stuff when I was ready to leave. Let&amp;#x27;s see.<br>
Bryntle, The Beast Slayer<br>
The Black Knight got the first chance in the fight to act<br>
and kill the creatures, so let&amp;#x27;s run through a scenario<br>
that involved him on the offensive, battling through hordes<br>
of undead while dealing hits to the undead.<br>
First up, make sure you know what an undead creature is.<br>
The Zombie<br>
The Necromancer<br>
The Zombie is basically a bunch of ghouls and it has<br>
come up in both real and fiction history.<br>
