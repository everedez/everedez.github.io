<h1>Cyber Sigil Tattoo</h1>
<p>Former members Cyber Sigil and Illidan the Outcast are confirmed to appear in Guardians of the Galaxy: Bend of the World and not the recent The Long Night, confirming that Marvel has been planning for a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and setting up appearances by Nick Knight, who appears to have been brought back as Marvel’s Cog. Iron Man 3 producer Kevin Feige has said that he’ll be in charge of the Guardians effort, while Guardians writer Alex Garcia confirmed his title upon confirming that he’ll do the screenplay. This means that at least 11 more characters will appear in Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
<p>In July, Kevin Feige was interviewed about Guardians of the Galaxy in EW’s July 11th issue and discussed the film. Feige said, “The movie was always set to do things on a smaller scale than we’ve done with Guardians of the Galaxy, and that has continued into this movie, not just because of those characters, but because we feel like this movie has to be seen as a stand-alone origin story where the bad guys get a new team to battle. With the core characters of the Guardians appearing, our heart was always in the studio and we felt that we were going to be able to get a lot more from them in the big finish.”</p>
<p>Guardians have also been linked to Iron Man 2 director Shane Black, with Feige saying, “He is the director who will start the story, he is the director who will be directing the movie, and that is, I think, the reason why we are not proceeding to, as I would say in the Marvel Studios universe, a multi-story because there is way too many things happening in one movie when you start talking about future, multiple movies.” Black is connected to the Guardians’ character to some degree, but not in the way most consider that Black was connected in X-Men: Days of Future Past.</p>
