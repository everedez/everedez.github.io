That&amp;#x27;s my creed for this part of Pop Quiz Arena, and I think it is the same in life. Being surprised by life is a good thing; there are so many things that can appear on your radar at unexpected times. There are so many things that can change your life and alter the course of things. The good thing is you can always be surprised ‚Äì that is, that no matter what is in the future you are not destined to find yourself in, you can always be surprised!">

<h1>Poetic Pop Quiz Afk Arena</h1>
<p>&amp;quot;Never be afraid to be surprised.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>That&amp;#x27;s my creed for this part of Pop Quiz Arena, and I think it is the same in life. Being surprised by life is a good thing; there are so many things that can appear on your radar at unexpected times. There are so many things that can change your life and alter the course of things. The good thing is you can always be surprised ‚Äì that is, that no matter what is in the future you are not destined to find yourself in, you can always be surprised! And that is a very positive thing to bring to a person&amp;#x27;s life and life in general! The second thing that can surprise you is always the fact that you are not the only one that thinks and the world that you live in! That is the most fantastic thing that can happen to you!! Now, for a part of my life in Pop Quiz Arena, I&amp;#x27;ve often looked at myself in the mirror and wondered what kind of person I was. I&amp;#x27;m sure some people say, ‚Äúoh she is so funny and unique!.‚Äù I think it&amp;#x27;s natural for a person that is famous or even a movie star to notice one of you in the mirror and want to chat with you on the spot (as every movie star does üòäüò± üò∂). And I want to talk with you about the things that you put on your head, what you put on your body (and my head is on the way to my body üòç) and everything you put on your tosh (and I am). I feel more and more funny in my life as I get older and my outlook on life is more determined. So I thought: ‚Äúwhat can I do in life that would allow me to feel more amazing and more more confident in myself?‚Äù That is when I came across The Afk Arena. This is basically all that I&amp;#x27;ve done in Pop Quiz Arena! It&amp;#x27;s not great, but it is real. And there are so many things that I hope to do in Pop Quiz Arena. Some of them may be absurd, some impossible, but to me, as the star-director of it all, nothing is absurd. So please come along with me and I will explore all in the hopes of teaching you something valuable. And guess what?</p>
