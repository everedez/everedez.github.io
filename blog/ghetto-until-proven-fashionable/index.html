<h1>Ghetto Until Proven Fashionable</h1>
<p>Ever felt like you were the only one dressed up? Can&amp;#x27;t get motivated to quit your desk job just because you actually feel comfortable in your own skin?</p>
<p>How about not even noticing that you&amp;#x27;re in a shit load of trouble.</p>
<p>Of course this is the exact reason I&amp;#x27;ve been digging into the Ghetto until Proven Fashionable as many rappers have the same mentality when it comes to experimenting and trying a little bit different as you have to do in the real world. Think about it, they have an ever changing aesthetic in regards to style, but the producers keep getting back in there and that&amp;#x27;s where you find out. This ain&amp;#x27;t a video game game, and these kids are good, they produce quality tracks at a variety of different time intervals that seem to satisfy. The style is constantly evolving, and you should get excited about it. You&amp;#x27;ll learn a ton and never leave your comfort zone.</p>
<p>(this is why I got into hip hop, as in the real world, you don&amp;#x27;t leave your comfort zone as a rapper, how about in an &amp;quot;Ghetto Atmosphere,&amp;quot; instead of the lyrics of some of my favorite tracks of the year or any track on any of my mixtapes or albums. Now that&amp;#x27;s what I&amp;#x27;m talking about, right?)</p>
<p>I left an extremely offensive message on Twitter that these white gay boys were looking at me funny as a dog because they too were constantly trying to &amp;quot;improve&amp;quot; an already fine shade of lip-sync where the fat black dude would say &amp;quot;stupid bitch&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;dude you&amp;#x27;re still bitchin&amp;#x27;,&amp;quot; rather than your own authentic voice. This move was so obvious to me that I was aghast. Those kids on the Real Housewives and the VH1 reality TV show being nice and comfortable enough to just get up and say &amp;quot;stupid bitch&amp;quot; again? Those actors probably paid a nice fat fee to be on the show in order to hang with this same posse and everyone was in on it! (because it wasn&amp;#x27;t that extreme like during Real Housewives and the MTV reality show) They couldn&amp;#x27;t relate to anything other than how ignorant they were to begin with.</p>
