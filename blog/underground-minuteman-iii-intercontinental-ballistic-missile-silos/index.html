<h1>Underground Minuteman Iii Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Silos</h1>
<p>Quick Quiz This issue refers to a proposed project that would be underground silos to manufacture Minuteman Iii and the Ions for Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests. The Ions are intended to provide a new “missile warhead” for a future missile defense system and are also intended to enhance the lethality of the I-class submarines. Minuteman II silos are to be constructed in underground silos similar to silos for plutonium production. The planned approach to silo construction indicates that all of the construction will be underground. Plausible reasons include: Minuteman II silos will take on the same attributes as Minuteman I silos, with minor details that vary, including installation of new, hardened structures on the silos, and use of general methods developed for low-cost construction similar to the way Minuteman I silos were constructed. Estimates of initial costs and construction timeline indicate that a single Minuteman I or Minuteman II silo complex is both feasible and economical for Minuteman II deployment. Costs and costs data further indicate that the proposed construction of silos is economical both in terms of engineering and cost. Costs and cost information is provided by the Defense Contract Management Association.

This page is maintained by the DCMA. A summary of nuclear security&amp;#x27;s policy regarding nuclear facilities is published here. http://nuclearsecurity.org/reports/washington-dc-massachusetts-nuclear.pdf More information about nuclear operations and security and risks for nuclear facilities is provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Security Advisory Commission (NSAC) and the Government Accountability Office. Such information should be reviewed very carefully with respect to any possible military or commercial use, since any failure to do so could result in significant damage or loss of life, and impede emergency preparedness and resiliency. The IAEA and NSAC have the unique authority to assess and direct the allocation of nuclear material resources among regional and other governments, for the purposes of nuclear security operations and for other policies. http://peace-transaction.</p>
