<h1>Dark And Darker Cleric Spells</h1>
<p>Celeste, the fourth of six children, grows into a powerful and charming wizard. When she is six years old she starts to feel the call to become a Jedi. As she sits quietly practicing her Jedi techniques she starts to fall in love with Jedi Master Agatha, who just happens to be a dark and the first of six children. When she meets Jaina she finds out that her parents thought that she was a child but that it was just her imagination.</p>
<p>Celeste starts out as a good, practical girl. Eventually she forms a close friendship with Princess Leia, and it is with her support that Celeste transforms to the light. As she becomes a powerful Dark Jedi, she becomes a different person and evolves in ways she never imagined possible. But with all of Celeste&amp;#x27;s powers, her power-hungry mother finds her.</p>
<p>After her family goes to live with her grandfather, Celeste doesn&amp;#x27;t just master her powers, she experiences a real transformation. When she travels back in time to her childhood, she changes into a different person entirely, growing and changing, before meeting up with the daughter, Jedi Katarina Palpatine. Together, they make a great team, both powerful, and change in a blink of an eye.</p>
<h2>Battlefield</h2>
<p>The dark side of the Force in the Star Wars universe is represented by the light side. Force lightning is a powerful ally to those who are in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Can be used on anybody so long as your source of light is from within a dark region. Is often called on in single-shot confrontations</p>
<p>An enemy that is in the right place at the right time. Has to be your target and force lightning must be of a certain level</p>
<p>When multiple parties of the same gender with the same force lightning level are close to each other, an ice storm can form that can damage almost anything.</p>
<p>A more powerful version of ice storm is available.</p>
<h2>Gloating</h2>
<p>Cold-like energy that starts small and builds up to several meters. If it is not ice-like, it can potentially become glowing</p>
<p>The light side of the Force is always dangerous. How the light wielder is prepared to deal with the dangers is when we get to the end of the book. It applies equally to all wielders and all roles/roles within a team.</p>
