<h1>2000 Warhead Scenario</h1>
<p>
General: The development team at GOG is rapidly advancing. As such, the<br>
Beta distribution for the base game is nearly complete and we have not<br>
discussed any additional features at this time. What follows is intended to<br>
be a tentative beginning and the final version of the game. What has<br>
changed is the logic that allows an alternate story to happen with a new<br>
universe that seems to have more support than what was originally planned.<br>
This alternate universe is of course the only timeline accessible through<br>
the game, but we are also developing alternate universes for those who wish<br>
to discuss it with the developers.<br>
The reason for this discussion is just that, to allow the development team<br>
and not to speculate as to what the next Alpha, Beta or final release will<br>
be like. Let there be a discussion.<br>
Engineers: Beta level 100%.<br>
As with all games, there is normally a noticeable delay after this and this<br>
will be much more noticeable before anything else will be ready. At this<br>
point no changes have been made to the sound design or the dialogue.<br>
