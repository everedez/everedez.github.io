<h1>Undead King Teihen Boukensha Chapter 1</h1>
<p>
By Parkin<br>
Chapter 1<br>
The young and arrogant man looked up from his own set of studies calmly.<br>
</p>
<p>His pupils must not forget his age, he thought. He looked at the man and wondered why he was discussing with him. Was the man madly curious or did he plan to teach what he knew? What brought this arrogant young man to this island?</p>
<p>By the ocean-bottom village lay the lair of the city-lord Shuan Chan, the man of his fears, the man who trained three hundreds of men.</p>
<p>
He studied the young man. His face was alert, but composed.<br>
The man knew that there was a boy among them, a young man he had seen near the village before. His name was Tan&amp;#x27;yu.<br>
The man slowly arose from his studies.<br>
&amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot; the young man asked, his voice still composed.<br>
The arrogant young man smiled wickedly and answered easily. &amp;quot;I am to be trained to be a lord and a warrior.&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;But at our age you should not be so brave and talk so much!&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;I am not afraid - I have lived so many years in the city of fear that that is all I can do.&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;But in the island there are young men are few, you can join them? Our lord has not taught to do that.&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;I am grateful for what has been given to me. Perhaps I can come to find out more and make this worth your time.&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;I can understand that the city will be unhappy, since you are so young.&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>&amp;quot;However,&amp;quot; the young man continued as if he had said nothing until now, &amp;quot;I have had enough of this city of fear. I am not afraid anymore, either, nor will I have a single request asked of me.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;And what if the mayor of the city should ask, what shall I tell them?&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I will give it to them myself, since that is what I am, a master. Would that the city could trust me as I trust the people of the land beneath the ocean. But yes, I will tell them what I can, now that I am master.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Take the small boat down the center of the island,&amp;quot; the young man suggested.</p>
