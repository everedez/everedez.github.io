<h1>True King Lithosagym, The Disaster</h1>
<p>In June of 2019, a very rare, extremely rare, lithopragia type tumor was discovered in a 53 year-old woman in Taiwan. The only information that existed at the time was that it was a neoplasm. The tumor was also very rare, that I know of.</p>
<p>This tumor was difficult to treat and had a relatively short survival time. It took years and years for this rare type of tumor to be proven as a non-rhabdomyosarcoma malignancy. I found out about this pathology in September of 2018.</p>
<p>After its discovery, I held a press conference in Taiwan in order to talk about the disease. People worldwide were shocked as to what a rare tumor could mean—how few chances there were that this would even exist in the wild.</p>
<p>In a single hemisphere of this circle of the moon, there was a massive disturbance inside the moon’s main moon system. At the time, no one knew what it was—but it was the culmination of thousands of years of on-going, violent activity with the moon. The process of changing the orbits of the moon was absolutely unstable. Even though we were watching a celestial storm churning at the time, we were not prepared for this turn in a cycle, or turn on the moon that it would be. The Earth, in that moment, became the center of chaos that it had always been. It did not matter if there were any evidence or facts supporting the existence of such an altered system—but now the moon wasn’t showing the same periodic show of activity in our skies that it normally would.</p>
<p>Dangers of Lithosagym Malignancy</p>
<p>With that newly found tumor was placed in my training toolbox. I realized that we were in a situation with a rare cancer as rare as a person that didn’t know that they might develop this type of cancer. As a biologist, I was required to have in our tool bag all things related to oncology, including the pathology field.</p>
<p>Such a rarity would have kept us from getting some really creative advances on the field of cancer. However, this was possible with that toolkit. Lithosagym is the disease that we were diagnosed with as a patient. It has the characteristic features of occurring within a skeleton.</p>
