<h1>Autogenic Training</h1>
<p>The idea of education can be traced as far back as the early seventh century B.C.E., which bardical Heraclea said about the importance of hard work and discipline:</p>
<p>Here are these things (training), when you see them, your hand, with time, can be on your forehead, your hand, with time, can grasp with the hands all kinds of matter and make it turn to every kind of shape.</p>
<p>If we understand by education the quality of an inherent human self, which is a product of an inescapable necessity, as it is not created from nothing, but is constantly renewed in the hands of teachers and experts as a result of an effort and perseverance, we find that whatever is learned always renews the same; to the point of generating a future which can never be produced but on the contrary depends upon it.</p>
<p>(Heraclea 2:35)</p>
<p>For the writer, the development from childhood is a cycle of development in which an individual is led from childhood to maturity to old age, which in itself is the first form in which the adult, of different ages, has to find his own origin, and that in the process of this self-discovery is enabled to rise to higher heights.</p>
<p>Through that self-discovery or knowledge, it also comes to know something of the source of the power of self-creation and through it, becomes endowed with the power of self-production.</p>
<p>It is important to keep under vital consideration that education is not the activity for a lifetime. It is that which over time can be a serious drain on an individual&amp;#x27;s energy. So, it is essential that the education of the individual, which over the years forms the basis of his own growth and development, is carried out on a daily basis which enables the student to approach and complete as rapidly as possible, the task of knowing him to the limits of his capabilities.</p>
<p>This is the pedagogical principle of the apprenticeship system and is precisely the reason why the child learns by an apprenticeship in this way.</p>
<p>The teacher prepares him to reach the point of complete self-development, but this is achieved thanks to the discipline and training exercised on him.</p>
<p>By working with him as a trainer he also educates himself.</p>
