<h1>Pro Sendr</h1>
<p>Israel’s media silence on the Palestinian youth and political activists’ resistance to the Israeli army’s onslaught on Hebron and its surroundings against Jerusalem, raises questions on whether they are engaged on radicalised civil disobedience against the occupation or not. While the media focus on Palestinian political prisoners is a rather foreign notion for Israeli writers and politicians, Palestinians themselves actively challenge the settler system rather than fighting it by disengaging from it. This means that the Palestinian youth and political activists have every right to their political independence. They are activists and revolutionaries who are fighting for their rights and have every right to develop and resist the occupation with their eyes before the international world because this is precisely what their resistance within Israel and the Occupied Territories does. The Arab Spring in Egypt, Syria and Yemen reminds us that it is in the resistance of activists inside Egypt and their resistance in Syria and Yemen not only that these countries have seen the downfall of the dictatorships but the rise of their revolutions. Egypt and Syria have seen themselves become the key in the Arab revolutions.</p>
<p>The media appears reluctant to report on these developments not because Israel has launched new wave of bombings and ongoing military invasion in Israel, but because the Israeli media doesn’t wish to portray the resistance of these Palestinians. We will come to this afterwards. The media’s attempts to turn over this issue as a civil rights issue to Israel’s right to govern Palestinians and deny them their rights to their land are rather bizarre. It is not that Palestinians are committing crimes against Israel or Israel has a wrong to do them. It is rather for the media to get Israel to justify their assault against their land. Until and unless they do this, the Israeli population will still have to face the threat of being displaced from their land as they flee from the onslaught of Israeli settlers. This will be a death sentence for Israel and all of the Israeli media has a great responsibility to cover Palestinian political resistance in these times. While the media was at it, the media have not done justice to the essence of the resistance movement. Without covering the Palestinian youth’s resistance as a political act, the Israeli population would have been denied their right to legitimate political and territorial independence that they have not. This would surely be a far more accurate account of this historical historical phenomenon.</p>
