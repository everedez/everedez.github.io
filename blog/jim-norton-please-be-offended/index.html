<h1>Jim Norton Please Be Offended</h1>
<p>I’ve never been in a debate. I’ve never even considered wanting to be in one. I’m a liberal and generally have liberal friends. But this particular conservative forum is the only forum on the internet that uses words like “Nazi”. Those words come from Nazi Germany and are used by certain groups who need a way to define “Nazi” as a white person as a hate group. Basically, the purpose of these words is to divide people. And this has caused me more conflict than most of my liberals share. I am upset by this site’s presence because I believe the word is inaccurate. I think it is not a racist term and has been over and over used by political leaders as a hate group term. I am also upset that Mr. S. is being called a Nazi.</p>
<p>I am also upset because this site uses the term Nazi as a noun, when I believe that it should be used as a verbs-noun. “Nazi” would be an adjective. Nazis have a noun that stands for the group of people who “Nazify” other people, not the people themselves. So my use of the word Nazi as a noun would accurately reflect my usage of the word. I used it because I thought it was politically incorrect to use a term that some of our allies see as racist. And in addition, it is because it is an active verb word. It puts the Nazis into action. Not just a passive concept that would be reflected as an adjective to the word “Nazi”. “Nazi” is a very active verb, like “Nazify”. The Nazis actively fought against racial equality. The Nazis supported the genocide of the Jews.</p>
<p>So I would like to use my neo Nazi content Nazi forum to do my part of supporting his claim that I use that word incorrectly. I’ll include an alternate. In a democratic society which opposes Nazi ideology, I would like to call “Nazi” a racist insult. And I’d like for other neo Nazi forum members to voice their objection and hurt my feelings.</p>
