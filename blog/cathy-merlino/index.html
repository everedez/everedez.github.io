ORDER AND JUDGMENT *<br>
The Court has considered this cause on the record and concludes the<br>
appeal should not be dismissed based on the following decisions: (1) On<br>
remand, the trial court is directed to conduct a hearing to determine the<br>
amount of fees requested and a reasonable rate and method of computing the<br>
reasonable cost of the attorneys’ services; (2) the parties are directed to file<br>
with the Court a joint status report containing any relevant information on<br>
their proceedings; and (3) the case is remanded to the Trial Court and to the<br>
Honorable Debra J. Holtsclaw, the presiding Justice of the Court, to<br>
determine the amount of fees requested in light of the above.<br>

is unclear, we direct the parties to pursue any necessary discovery in<br>
connection therewith, including interrogatories, requests for documents,<br>
copies of papers, depositions, or any other means reasonably available to<br>
the parties.<br>
