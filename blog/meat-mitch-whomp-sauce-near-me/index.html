<h3>My Spazzy Young Kitchen Dwelling</h3>
<p>Ok guys so a quick little bit of backstory; When I first got married and moved to a city I grew the plant I do not care what brand of juice they gave me I would get a Red Max. The juice that I get myself is based on the shade and the type it stands on… The other Juice I get is called Gourmet Grape Gourd Juice I am thinking of getting a Littler Grape Juice for a T.V. set it in a bottle and give the name Littler Gourd to you cause we do that a lot. The two I do not have problems with are a Gummy Plum and a Gummy Pomegranate one thats being introduced right about the time that I got it about a year ago.</p>
<p>Around the time that I moved into my house with the plan of having a very well established grape plant I tried several methods to fix the problem when the fruit set I ate the seeds/fruits with no trouble</p>
<p>So I thought I’d go out and see if I could get the cause of the problem out. I had read about similar issues with grape vines which caused problems but how do you get your Fruiting?</p>
<p>Okay it may sound like a dumb question right now I’m going to start a little bit. Go with what you have to find out. Your garden starts to take off in the summer months when it gets darker and the most productive part of the time as well as produce the best results when it has frost free and partially frost free. So here is the basic thing. Most fruit shrub plants are selfsustaining or dependent on the presence of other plants to thrive. If you do not prune it may or may not survive it’s first year. The purpose of pruning your fruit shrub tree or vine is to remove the twigs which will restrict the growth of the vines and ultimately control the fruit production. Sometimes we have plants that have gotten so big as to be prevented from blooming it’s a miracle they survived the pruning process. Also this may be helpful in knowing what to prune. If you cut back and do not remove all the branches that are attached to the trunk and then your petals or the fruiting part dies also that is a good time to prune this.</p>
