<h1>Kodak Easyshare C503</h1>
<p>A rare Kodak E200 EFS2 card now comes with Kodak Easyshare Photo Recovery software, removing all of the settings and creating one easy user friendly solution to recover your photos from the Kodak Easyshare EFS2 model.</p>
<p>The software was downloaded to your computer by a Kodak customer that does not know how to set the software up, so we helped him create a quick setup and then packed it away in a nice new box. A very special thank you to Andy C, who read our packing instructions and made it worth reading.</p>
<p>Want to help this great new product get into the hands of more of our customers? For a very limited time, and while supplies last, you can bring Kodak Easyshare Photo Recovery software with you on your next delivery and receive a special 10% discount for Kodak Easyshare EFS2 customers who purchase both Kodak Easyshare EFS2 software and photo recovery for a single item from Best Buy.</p>
<p>Click here for more info:</p>
<p>To back up your files before backing up and restoring photos from the EFS2, you can download the Image Recovery Utility from this link.</p>
<h2>Technical Notes:</h2>
<p>The Kodak Easyshare software is a full ISO-quality version of this standard quality software. As such, these software versions are identical or similar. Each program includes enough of the original software to save thousands of additional files on the disks, and remove any of the original software settings like, for example, those used for duplicating your files. When a customer purchases both a Kodak Easyshare Photo Recovery EFS2 software product and our EFS2 Photo Recovery EFS2 software, our EFS2 Photo Recovery software will automatically uninstall any software they do not specifically purchase from us.</p>
<p>The EFS2 Software is geared for people who use the Kodak Easyshare EFS2 model only, NOT for all models, any of which are available. It includes all user or internal programs in all of the major categories of Kodak Easyshare EFS2.</p>
