<h1>Van Zandt Bloodhound Team</h1>
<h3>Career</h3>
<h3>WALK FORWARD</h3>
<p>First, back in 1986 to become the premier walk and trot competition in the WNBA. After her rookie season, Van Zandt, first trained by former Olympic swimmer Ann McKeever, was the walk and trot leader to the 1999 All-Star game. Her success in the league earned her her most-decorated WNBA title from 1999 to 2001 when she participated in her first WNBA All-Star Game.</p>
<p>In 2002 after playing in most the league&amp;#x27;s rookie tournaments, Van Zandt moved up to the number two pick in the league. Her team was at the first round in 2005 making it into the playoffs, where she faced two first round draft picks: Orlando Magic and Lisa Leslie. After her game-tying game-winning free throw in the fourth quarter, she managed the upset win over the Leslie’s by 5 points.</p>
<p>In her first season as captain before she earned her All-Star jersey in the 2005 season. She went on to win over 5,000 fan votes and was named to the All-Star game where she averaged 18.4 points and 3.0 steals per game.</p>
<p>In her sophomore season, in 2006-07, she again led her team and was named to all six games. But then, the Trail Blazers organization decided that player development would improve the Trail Blazers, a part of their American TV deal, which effectively banned Van Zandt’s team from the playoffs. When the season was over as she didn’t play in the games, she was suspended by the Trail Blazers. As of 2008, she has yet to play in a game in the WNBA.</p>
<h2>BLOODSHOT</h2>
<p>A native of Phoenix, AZ, Van Zandt grew up in Garden City, CA watching many high school teams throughout the Valley. She is proud a native of Southern California, with family all residing there.</p>
<p>When she started playing NCAA Division I college basketball at Arizona, her school&amp;#x27;s very first letterman title came along when she scored a game-high 35 points against Cincinnati in a regional final in 2001.</p>
<p>Even though she graduated from Arizona, she went back to school at Arizona State University to study law. She also coached the women&amp;#x27;s volleyball and basketball teams during her time at ASU.</p>
