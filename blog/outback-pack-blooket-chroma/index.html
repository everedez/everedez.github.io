I have also added some different variations using the new material system.Hope you all like this and want to know more about the new version. It is now available for you to use.Thanks for your support!The new version is the lowest version released so far which means it uses the original textures but with certain minor changes.I cannot list all of the quality settings here but if you wanna see an exhaustive list go to the official FAQ here.Please take care and let me know how the update has gone for you!By: enrico della vitaBy: enrico della vita For: enrico della vita (enrico della vita enrico della vita on November 17, 2009 - 14:12) &amp;quot;I had a very angry outburst on the first day of working on the new update. Imagine, after so many years of not using the texture engine on any large-scale projects (scaling film stock and adding features to an existing software ), the thought of having to use it on a game is terrifying.</p>
<p>Of course, I knew this game would need a lot of work and I was afraid I would not do it well. I had a lot of good reasons for believing that it would be a huge hit. However, the previous version never showed any of the negative effects of using the engine, and the time of launch from Kickstarter shows that the gamers had high expectations. Just like how the game was never released, not counting the one-off campaign. We&amp;#x27;ve reached our Kickstarter goal, and though we&amp;#x27;re not yet done, we should be releasing the first update in the next few months. So, from now onwards you will see a little bump in the box before the main game.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;A little bump in the box... of course... very reassuring.</p>
