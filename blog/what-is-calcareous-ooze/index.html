<h1>What Is Calcareous Ooze?</h1>
<p>Also known as Eclampsia or Hydrogel Giant, Calcareous ooze is thick, viscous fluid that also spreads out through joints, and may cause swelling in joints and muscles. Most often it forms inside the joints and in these joints throughout the body (including the kidney, liver, and spleen, lungs and joints). Sometimes it forms in the abdomen and even arteries — sometimes the largest arteries in the body.</p>
<p>
Calcareous “ooze” can also break down some proteins in the body, causing severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.<br>
It is also a buildup in the kidneys, the liver and blood vessels that can cause the blood and fluid to clot.<br>
So What Is The Question?<br>
</p>
<p>We are all familiar with the Eclampsia – a condition where a person has blood pressure dipping too low, and from a medical point of view, Eclampsia is a dangerous condition that can lead to stroke, kidney damage, kidney failure (low blood pressure), and death.</p>
<p>It is therefore amazing that the cause of Eclampsia is an illness called hydrogel giant. Even though being in a great deal of pain can be stressful for those with Eclampsia, the illness process, causing blood inside the brain and lungs for clotting. In most cases, there is an acute phase that includes headaches and nausea. It then progresses to a fluid accumulation and kidney edema (swelling in the kidney), which then carries on until death.</p>
<p>In fact, the treatment for Eclampsia is to place a catheter in the subclavian vein and remove the fluid — although it can be tricky and carries risks.</p>
<p>This is where Calcareous “ooze” comes in. Calcareous “ooze,” the fluid that can cause stroke and kidney failure in Eclampsia (the “ooze” being the fluid that is causing the blood and fluid to clog up the blood vessels), can cause Calcareous “ooze” in some way.</p>
<p>Once the Calcareous “ooze” reaches the brain, it can cause stroke, kidney failure, and kidney damage.</p>
