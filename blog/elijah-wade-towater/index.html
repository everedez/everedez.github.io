<h1>Elijah Wade Towater</h1>
<p>7. This is as close to a fact about the Elijah Wade Towater as we are likely to get:</p>
<p>Wade, a former State Department staffer, visited Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad for five days in 2004 to make unauthorized photographs of the U.S. prison, used for interrogation of suspected terrorists, for publication. He said he was there to document, on the witness stand, the scope of the American prison system&amp;#x27;s brutal interrogation methods.</p>
<p>But we know that he died while recording that story â€” in fact he didn&amp;#x27;t die on the scene.</p>
<p>The story was covered by the Associated Press news service on Saturday:</p>
<p>He died less than an hour after being admitted to the hospital from the injuries he suffered. He suffered cardiac arrest the day after he was admitted.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;There are absolutely no regrets from me. I did nothing that required it,&amp;quot; He said.</p>
<p>There is no way to verify the details in the story to be exact, and according to an AP investigation, Wade was in Iraq to take photographs.</p>
<p>As Paul Williams of NBC put it:</p>
<p>And, in 2006, the AP reported:</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Wade&amp;#x27;s family said the photographer had &amp;quot;no hesitation in coming forward to tell his story&amp;quot; and thanked &amp;quot;everyone who was so generous in helping with his medical care.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>They said his family was &amp;quot;praying for his speedy recovery.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>3. We don&amp;#x27;t know whether Wade&amp;#x27;s shooting partners are a family, an old school friend or just a good looking young guy in Iraq. We do know that he was lying on the floor with &amp;quot;bloated lungs&amp;quot; and had no pulse, so we don&amp;#x27;t have reason to doubt that he was dead before he hit the ground.</p>
<p>Some people reading this story might think it&amp;#x27;s a relief to learn that Wade is actually alive.</p>
<p>This same story is reporting the name of his shooter.</p>
<h2>From the AP:</h2>
<p>Cpl. Brian Gray, 21, was shot in the left chest and abdomen during the three-hour ordeal at about 12:30 a.m. A soldier with the 4th Division, he later died in the hospital.</p>
