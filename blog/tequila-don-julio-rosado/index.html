<h1>Tequila Don Julio Rosado</h1>
<p>It is the Saturday night: the place to be for the moment is at Canaima Street.</p>
<p>When I open the door and see Guillaume Audelire, it’s a moment where one gets an insight into life at Saint Antoine de Padoue. However, the expression of the two rooms where he always works is very important. The two rooms with the French doors facing each other! Did you see them? What a contrast! Almost, French and European but a mixture of both; very diverse, very cosmopolitan, very musical!</p>
<p>I’ve arrived very early at this Saturday’s space, my arrival is quite amazing indeed. It is an unprecedented surprise, the ground floor of this block of three dwellings.</p>
<p>The space</p>
<p>Inside the space is a kitchen, where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served.</p>
<p>And there, an important part of this kitchen is the grill, that serves a mix of dishes made in the space and others prepared by Audelire who always looks elegant.</p>
<p>The space has a dining table covered in a dark blue tablecloth, it also has lighting effects, projected in a variety of colors with an outdoor bench. You can also buy some newspapers for yourself!</p>
<p>Two tables are set on a small terrace, one on each side of the windows, on this terrace Guillaume, wearing his usual dress of dark blue suit and a white shirt, showing beautiful hair.</p>
<p>The view from the terrace is unique, one can also see the square where the spotlights were installed!</p>
<p>The people</p>
<p>Guillaume Audelire is a highly valued person, an entrepreneur, he was a chef when he arrived in México, he owns a restaurant called Oasque or Verde that is situated in San Miguel ántez, the same place where I just spent a week.</p>
<h2>Tequila Don Juan</h2>
<p>Yes, that’s true, not a day passed without tasting or making a homemade-tasal to this bodega where your menu is set, as it was that day.</p>
<p>It begins with a snack of tea and sandwiches made in the space of this restaurant. Then, there is a hot meal of beef, chicken, beef, rice, bean and more food to start the party.</p>
