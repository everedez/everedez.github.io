<h1>Starbucks Lavender Haze</h1>
<p>My Dad knows the coffee industry. He might as well have called up a large company and said, &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m buying us some Starbucks Lavender Haze.&amp;quot; For a split-second, I thought he was going to buy a huge shipment of pure coffee. Maybe he could gift his very large dog with some aromatic scones he&amp;#x27;d ordered?</p>
<p>Perhaps my Dad would have been able to drop lavender into the ground where he had grown up in a household that had neither dyes nor perfumes. Or could he have brought a fine tea from London or Southern France? Surely some of the major coffee houses had lavender as part of the offering! The instant that I saw his wild child imagination coming into focus, I recognized my callous assumption was unwarranted (at least for the sake of this story). The idea of creating magic was out of left field. That was for sure.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Sweet, Sparky,&amp;quot; my sister said, handing me a heavy copy of &amp;quot;Fire in the Water.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Mimi writes about people who wake in the morning, hear a breeze and smell it just like this.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>I snagged the book and then stopped myself. What on earth was I about to read?</p>
<p>&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s called The Secret Almanac,&amp;quot; I said to Mimi, holding up the book with my finger in the title. &amp;quot;I think you should look at it.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Do you really think I&amp;#x27;d let Mimi work with me?&amp;quot; Mimi queried, holding the book in front of her face with that crooked little index finger of hers.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Darling, it&amp;#x27;s the finest book on metaphysics and all sorts of metaphysical crap you could ever imagine,&amp;quot; Mimi said, giving the book back. &amp;quot;Go on up to my room and drink a glass of milk, it&amp;#x27;s gonna cost you a pound.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Which was fine with me. Too many people were about to share a bottle of coffee with me. I accepted, preferring my coffee spiked with vitamin V just in case something terrible happened. Mimi did not even comment.</p>
<p>
She walked off, two paces away from the table, cup in hand.<br>
&amp;quot;Wait!&amp;quot; I held the book out in front of her. &amp;quot;This book is on metaphysics.&amp;quot;<br>
Now she turned to me, her eyes wide. &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re kidding!&amp;quot;<br>
&amp;quot;Absolutely not.<br>
</p>
