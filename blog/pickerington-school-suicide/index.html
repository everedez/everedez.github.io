<h1>Pickerington School Suicide</h1>
<p>January 2005, there is an ongoing debate about education at the high school level. In all states the children of the rich and educated always get a better education than the poorest children. This is a general rule, but it applies to children from poor backgrounds. It also applies to children from rural and urban areas within a particular state. It does not apply to children from different States, in all of America. Public schools can be either educational and/or political. Education, politics, and education in high school become very important. Schools have been charged with many tasks. They should tend to serve certain needs, and so should the students within them. Children enter their public school in a state and location which is appropriate for them. A child of a certain kind should stay in a particular school. (To a rural boy in a smaller town he needs to go to a private school, and to an urban boy he should be moved to a public school, in his own town.) This means that families and community are invited to share in some of the decisions and actions made in the school.</p>
<p>As a child of a certain race, class, socioeconomic status, and location, I chose to attend a public high school. This is also the least suitable school for certain children, even though it is well-prepared and for free, which is one of the most important advantages a public school has over one of the other kinds of schools: fee-charging private schools, which are still very popular and offer plenty of educational resources. Even though it is on a public campus, the school is typically a private (government-run) institution. However, when you attend a public and independent high school (even a private high school), the school feels more or less like the family of the teacher who taught you there.</p>
<p>The best high schools are by those standards the best educational institutions. That is what some people say. Like the best good general stores you can find in town, the best universities and good general stores have good teachers. The best university is in my opinion still private, though it is in California. Two different schools have the top ranking.</p>
<p>My high school was a little bit of the public one. I felt a little bit of that public distance. No doubt because I was a new student to the school. But after awhile, I was made to feel a little more at home.</p>
