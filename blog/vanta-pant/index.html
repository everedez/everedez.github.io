<h1>Vanta Pant</h1>
<h3>By Perk Will Not Lie</h3>
<p>I was walking past a house in the middle of a war zone in Ilu, at the border between Ilu and Tigray. I felt so shocked that I thought I&amp;#x27;ll immediately fall on the ground.</p>
<p>I was walking past a house in the middle of a war zone in Ilu, at the border between Ilu and Tigray. I felt so shocked that I thought I&amp;#x27;ll immediately fall on the floor. I thought for sure it would never happen in my life, but it turned out when I was getting near the house, I felt something inside.</p>
<p>I didn&amp;#x27;t know what it was. For a moment, everything around me was frozen and I couldn&amp;#x27;t move. I didn&amp;#x27;t dare to move forward. I was overwhelmed by such a strong sense of dread that I will probably never forget it. I took a few steps forward but the sensation that I was somehow being dragged, was horrific to me. Then, without warning, I screamed out in a very loud voice, and started to run.</p>
<p>When I saw the soldiers I raced around the house but found nothing but a tight spot in a hall of the building. However, the soldiers had been trapped underneath, and the sound was still continuing.</p>
<p>I immediately ran straightaway and rushed inside the room in which I was trapped. This room was closed by the walls and had no openings. There were no windows or doors that allowed anybody to escape.</p>
<p>I was scared. I already thought about to use brute force to break something, but then I remembered that I have no weapons. I remember that I was thinking about to use my teeth in order to open the door, but then I remembered that I have no teeth. I had to jump on the bed in order to unlock the door with both my feet.</p>
<p>I woke up from this nightmare, my heart pounding and sweat pouring from my head. I had managed to open the door, but what I found, just as I thought, was nothing but a big hole. I jumped on it and started to feel dizzy.</p>
<p>I was being imprisoned inside a room deep inside the grounds of the house, and in the middle of it, on one side an actual door, but under my feet, while the room around me was completely dark.</p>
