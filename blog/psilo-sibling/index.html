<h1>Psilo Sibling</h1>
<p>Ana and Joaquin Rubio ran through the usual process. Joaquin needed a “provision” in his bid to be qualified as an adult with a bona fide right to inheritance. Ana needed a parent’s ID number to apply for her birth certificate, so she could eventually get one of those. Joaquin had to comply with the court-ordered sex change and a condom testing clause in his juvenile jurisdiction petition, as well as the birth certificate rules. Ana even had to attend the July 19 hearing in the case, where the judge told her she had been warned that if she refused to comply with any of the court rules it would be barred from a hearing that might look like an inheritance case. These were things Ana had been able to do through her daughter and a few friends, and were still eligible for a birth certificate when all of that dried up. Joaquin’s bid required him to comply with a far more onerous document: the barograph representing the barcode of their parent’s marriage, the same document used in DNA testing to prove a parent’s paternity. Ana and Joaquin’s plan was to use Joaquin’s deceased father’s ID # to get his number on the birth certificate.</p>
<p>The filing of all this was a surprise to the Rubio family. Ana thought for a few days Joaquin would try to correct the problem, but apparently he didn’t. The Barricade Press got a call from Ana’s niece, who spoke with Joaquin only on the telephone and then would call Ana only after asking something he didn’t want to say himself.</p>
<p>It doesn’t hurt that Joaquin did all this before he got drunk on the night of the Barricade Press interview, had one too many drinks at some local bar, and threw up at the table where the family was sitting. One also had to assume that he had been served with underage alcohol or drugs, though the sobriety and breathalyzer test passed without any signs of alcohol intoxication.</p>
<p>A few questions prompted the questions to Joaquin:</p>
<p>Question: When you applied for your ID card, you did not provide the ID number of your mother, did you?</p>
<p>Answer: Well, that is a problem. We are not applying for a birth certificate, we are applying for a driver’s license.</p>
