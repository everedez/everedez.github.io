<h3>Tent City</h3>
<p>This post was originally written for Halloween on the subject of tent cities that need to be demolished. However, I was compelled to post it during the worst of all times, because there is already an emergency crisis underway in the political arena on the state level. A truly great post. The problem: Will Republicans win back the House if a conservative version of Bill C-69 passes?</p>
<p>As of today [in the 7th hour of the 2nd day of the 22nd assembly], Democrats have a clear majority in the House and could conceivably pass the legislation passed in the Senate and stand up a conservative version of it. The pressure on party leaders is high, and they are effectively calling their supporters and the media to act. The press (and a certain fringe blogger) need to swallow this lying-in-hiding bullshit when an individual Senator or a district representative calls them out publicly and for what they’re doing. When all parties are standing squarely against each other in the House in this chamber, the only thing both sides can do is try to stall on. There’s only one conclusion to be drawn: It’s going to be another GOP filibuster by a state senator. It won’t get that far - that’s not enough to make up a majority in either house - but it will get enough public pressure to get the bill re-introduced. Will Republicans lose the House even though they keep their majority in the Senate for now? Only if the Democrats simply refuse to let it happen.</p>
<p>But these are the exact kinds of internal fights that these parties had been losing for decades, and they’d finally be pushed into their current political morass with so much more public pressure building. Is it a good thing that they’re finally being forced to fight their last battle?</p>
<h2>1 Comments:</h2>
<p>Looks like nobody wants to buy into the fiction that Republicans are powerless under the immense pressure of the citizens and the media coming out to show their true colours. Republicans are fighting for freedom and are always fighting for their country back.</p>
<p>Perhaps even with the current House majority not there Republicans will be forced to fight for their country, and it will ultimately come right down the line to a trial and a prison sentence.</p>
