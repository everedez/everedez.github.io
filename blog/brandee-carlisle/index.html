Hey. This episode is written by my writer, who’s one of my friends, and I got to ask him a few questions, just so you guys could hear his perspective. They’re also good for helping you find out where I’m coming from to a certain extent. Thanks for listening.
Your story makes me how I’ve seen the game, you wrote about the first developer, who you mentioned kind of wanting to play.">

<p>Hey. This episode is written by my writer, who’s one of my friends, and I got to ask him a few questions, just so you guys could hear his perspective. They’re also good for helping you find out where I’m coming from to a certain extent. Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>Your story makes me how I’ve seen the game, you wrote about the first developer, who you mentioned kind of wanting to play. Can you tell us a little bit about that, what went on in terms of the writing and what kind of development process that particular team is.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Our lead guy, I think his name was Tycho, took us all through the first two days of development on our platform. It was a lot of small steps and things that you would just jump into, where you just walk in and try things out. As far as our production team, and where they go in a year, I would say they would send things back and forth a number of times before the actual game was set to be released so it’s a pretty involved process and work that they do.</p>
<p>You wrote about how it would feel to see the game come to console, I’m still really curious about that. I know you wrote about how it’s kind of surreal to go out and set out on this journey. You’re probably getting the feeling, from your interviews, that you’re going to see some of these games?</p>
<p>It’s something that people really should look into and I think those are kind of things that will be relevant to what you’re going to see on the way that you go on. You’re going to see them but some of them aren’t some of the things that you’d normally expect. In all honesty, I’m really keen to see what other people think about this. What people are going to enjoy or what is going to be new and useful to them as they might have differing opinions. I really hope people will look at this and enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Alright.</h2>
