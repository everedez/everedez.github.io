<h1>Often Imitated Never Duplicated Meme</h1>
<p>This is perhaps a most unoriginal meme of all, however it is an excellent alternative for that ever-reliable meme known as the Dumpster.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that I love trash of all kinds, and I’ll probably always, ALWAYS even if the economy collapses, end up homeless.</p>
<p>
I love New York, except when it rains in it.<br>
I love Brooklyn, but only at certain times of year (Winter is my favorite).<br>
I love the country side, and can typically speak of it simply as “All the places I’ve been.”<br>
</p>
<p>I love to show off my love for the odd and unusual, particularly the part of the United States that has only recently, inexplicably seen its major population decline.</p>
<p>
I love all of the newsprint, magazines, and newspapers that I read... and I also love books.<br>
I love all of the food, including the butter things, sweet things, and other things that I’m too young to eat.<br>
I love all of the things on the red tablecloth, and things placed under the red tablecloth with different things on it.<br>
I love other children.<br>
I enjoy being a picky person.<br>
I have a tendency to like good things that you can eat.<br>
I love the color green.<br>
I have been around while very little snow has melted.<br>
I am an angry person, but have learned how to cope with that in a semi-reasonable manner.<br>
I have traveled, and made great friends from all over the world.<br>
</p>
<p>I am addicted to the internet, which means I cannot just walk up to a computer and open email without some sort of compulsion to read, scroll down, and type, usually with a large keyboard.</p>
<p>I enjoy listening to music, but especially the music that’s music, not songs, otherwise known as songs.</p>
<p>And finally, like everyone else, I am a big fan of football. Especially when it’s loud, and on the same side of the field from me. I put up with this behavior so I can ask you to explain it before it becomes a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>I am, in all this, an ordinary person.</p>
