<h1>Life Tragedies Mod Sims 4</h1>
<p>Current mod for Skyrim</p>
<p>The Sims 4 is our new sims based sims based game!</p>
<p>This mod is for those of you who are familiar with The Sims 4, and for you others it allows you to completely rework your sims by modifying the games behaviour and acting more like a real life sim! To make this mod you need to have purchased the sims 4 and the game. Its called The Sims 4 Mod.</p>
<p>It is worth the money at about 35GB which is around Â£5.52. Hopefully it has the chance of not only changing the mood of your next sim, but of making you feel totally fabulous!</p>
<p>I made a mod file for Skyrim that allows you to turn a vanilla game into a sim based one, and it appears to do the job! To try it out, I think you need to be a modder as well, so if you think i have put out a simple hack for modding Skyrim, or has anyone made anything that makes you feel as awesome as me, let me know :) If you like this, and think it will work well with your current game, please check out my Sims 3 &amp;amp; 4 mod!</p>
<p>Thank you, Xorc</p>
<p>Xorc, My name is Xorc, I am a fan of Skyrim and have tried and tested many mods for the PS version of The Sims 4, all of which have failed except for this one, with only a single fix and patch which just works! You see it works by changing the ending screen of the game, and changing the resolution, which is it&amp;#x27;s only flaw, I have noticed.</p>
<p>My Sims 4 will no longer freeze when I try and do a save for it or return to game. That is how I found out it worked just by doing one. I have to remove the save in the game then come back and hope it doesn&amp;#x27;t save.</p>
<p>I have contacted Playstation Live and asked them if this mod applies to this version of the game as well, they said they are checking.</p>
