<p>A couple of years ago, the brilliant and prolific Rycosoft Software’s Forza series, has been released. One of the first things that I noticed in Forza and what lead me to become a big fan of the cars included in the game was it’s variety, its appeal, and, above all, how they actually looked. Most of the other racing games have models that are one-dimensional or just plain ugly. How could a racing title that has such obvious qualities get ripped so easily?</p>
<p>Well it happened during the very early development of a racing game and it wasn’t the cars that turned the players on the idea, rather it was the surroundings of the cars. Forza started with great promise and once it started out with a seemingly great idea, the world where the game was created was on fire with excitement because the beautiful cars, the stunning surroundings of the cars were more than what anyone could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>The problem was, when they decided to go the production in a game, they forgot about the fact that the production was supposed to be a simple and to the point game and it only served to frustrate gamers. Forza for the first few years remained a simple game making its existence a living nightmare. Rather than merely being the game that the internet made it out to be, Forza even went as far as creating angry headlines against the game because of its failure. When I consider all the changes, improvements, and overall evolution of the game, I couldn’t help to see that there was an overall direction in the game that was pretty much like that of “Racing”, “Performance Racing”, and even “Race For The Championship”. All these names indicate that this game is a good racing game.</p>
