<h1>Fredro Starr Charlamagne</h1>
<p>
Nick: So you’re a stripper.<br>
Paco: I’m a stripper.<br>
Nick: Well, I mean, I know I heard you tell a lady about it, but they just laughed you off you, right?<br>
Paco: No, they were all really curious about me.<br>
</p>
<p>Nick: [laughing] All right. Well, let’s get back to what it is you do in the strip shows. So you walk in with that outfit, right?</p>
<p>Paco: Sure, everyone from the audience looks at it.</p>
<p>Nick: But you just come out and make it known to everybody from the audience that’s why y’all are here for. You know, the audience is always gonna wait for you. You feel like a big shot that you’ve got some sort of pop at them because of the size of your skirt, right?</p>
<h2>Paco: Right</h2>
<p>Nick: Alright, y’all are gonna get down and make it known that y’all make up for me. Make it like you’re selling it on me. Yeah! All right. When do you usually come on the show after y’all go on about. We’ll call you in and we go back to our apartment to dress and all that?</p>
<p>Paco: [chuckling] Maybe a couple days a month. (chuckles) I try everything. (chuckles) It’s very rare that I get the opportunity to be in front of everybody. Maybe three or four times a year.</p>
<p>Nick: [chuckling] Three or four times a year. Alright, that’s not like the week you came in here with the sheet. That’s a million times more rare, I’m sure.</p>
<p>Paco: Of course! That’s for a strip show for me. My job is to make the customers happy. You know, that’s what I love about the job.</p>
<p>Nick: Well, you should always be super cheerful.</p>
<p>Paco: It’s also a woman’s job to be happy! You can’t get that anywhere else! I make the customer happy. You make the customer happy.</p>
