<p>• In the Q&amp;amp;A, all players must answer the following questions -</p>
<p>1. What was the best thing about your experience at the NBA Draft Combine?, A. Writing questions by the general public is...<br>
2. Did you (or did you not) feel the coaching staff was prepared? A. I feel the staff is extremely prepared with the league itself. The question about staff may come from (a) one person who hired for general manager, or from one of the scouts. Having a strict evaluation team was important to us to have that accountability. Our top three teams are, in my opinion, our scouts, our GM/coach, and our coaches.<br>
3. Which was the best trip you have ever taken? A. Going to Disney World, Vegas, Vegas, to take in the shows at the Mirage...<br>
4. Did the staff have any expectation that you would be a 5-star, or whatever, before going to New Jersey? A. All of the expectations were my responsibility to carry himself with professionalism and to understand the system, but any expectation could come from any supervisor at any level of the organization, but again, I am not a compliance officer. Although the New Jersey staff did have a strict requirement that all schools put $10,000 of their own money into his family tree for every scholarship one of them got from the state, so he did get to choose his path and all of the incentives.<br>
5. What is one of the crazier and possibly best things about the pro basketball that you have experienced? A. There are around 300 pro leagues in the US and half of those are going through NBA Draft Combine, so it is unheard of to see a lot of top pros in the US participate in the combine. It is a bizarre sport, where guys put on equipment and spend an hour trying to get invited to an event where maybe 1-2 out of 500 of them will win a scholarship by a metric ton, where there is no balance of any kind, or at least it is not a balance that some organizations are expecting.<br>
