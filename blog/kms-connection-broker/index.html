<h1>Kms Connection Broker</h1>
<p>Mesos Connection Broker is used to handle live and historical data from resource like monitoring resources, tools such as Kms Connection Broker and some custom data at per app levels as well as live backup / snapshot / restore solution.</p>
<p>
Mesos Connection Broker can be installed by default as Network Connectivity Broker, Mesos &amp;amp; Mesos Core Node.<br>
It makes use of the following key enablers.<br>
1) Mesos as a broker<br>
</p>
<p>Mesos has a well-established adoption rate and active community around it. Mesos was created long back when Mesos Project was launched in 2007 as a research project under the sponsorship of Google. The aim of Mesos research is to enable distributed systems to scale much faster than with traditional message-passing, RPC based systems. The project is open source software with Mesos being a main part of it.</p>
<p>Mesos connection broker will give you a simple way to access one or more resources (in our case MESOS, Kms, Mesos Connectivity Broker for QCD for example). You may use resources to perform any actions such as connect to a resource, detect the environment, communication with a resource, create a request, reporting on all the details or any other operations.</p>
<p>Such a simple and lightweight way to access resources and perform operations will help you enable more time-efficient applications which can perform load/stress tests, new deployment, work on any systems/applications quickly.</p>
<p>A key enabler of connection broker is its built-in data discovery engine which can not only help you obtain data but also configure it and facilitate visual data visualization and the ability to communicate with monitoring tools.</p>
<p>
2) Mesos &amp;amp; Mesos Core Node<br>
Mesos &amp;amp; Core Node are built on Python and Python SDK components.<br>
Mesos as a Broker takes a database &amp;amp; feeds it with Mesos data via a specialized RPC middleware.<br>
</p>
<p>This middleware enables the Broker to push information to other clients of Mesos like Mesos Connectivity Broker for QCD running on the Mesos Core Node.</p>
<p>With a Mesos Core Node your Broker can connect to Mesos for QCD.</p>
