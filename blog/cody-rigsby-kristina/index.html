<p>Chase Carey | Chase is in the middle of a media and legislative hurricane. We can understand the fascination and urge to contact her to help in the battle to roll back the corporate influence on our federal government and press. But we&amp;#x27;ve seen how Mr. Carey would act to side with that negative campaign as though he were their man, helping to place him as one of the architects of the coup in Ukraine with which the people of Ukraine found themselves facing. If we could just see him say it, we would applaud any and all politicians that act like he did, and no doubt without a crystal ball we may all have varying opinions, but as we&amp;#x27;ve seen with the actions of Mr. Carey as an attorney, there is his tendency to place himself above the citizen who fights for those with less rights and is willing to engage in acts which they never would willingly engage in out of self-preservation.The Attorney General has, in the first 9 months of her tenure, entered more contracts on behalf of his client than he has entered on behalf of the U.S. government, and those who work for him and/or his client have been awarded almost $7.4 million in commissions, which can only be justified as the realization of attorney-client business in this instance, and why won&amp;#x27;t he fight to protect his client&amp;#x27;s reputation and integrity? And I believe he should.After all, it&amp;#x27;s not just Ukraine with us any longer; it&amp;#x27;s the Philippines with him; it&amp;#x27;s Iran with him; and most of all as a fellow attorney we would like to see him stay up here in Washington to protect this client&amp;#x27;s and others&amp;#x27; right to be heard and tried for their crimes. So, we give him and do not want to see him go down. We would like to see him stay and see this thing through the coming appeals process, and if he&amp;#x27;s changed his mind about some of the things he said we&amp;#x27;d appreciate an update and acknowledgement of his change.Mr. Carey, your client is very fortunate. The U.S. government did not charge her with anything in the Ukraine case and Mr. Putin himself said on tape he wasn&amp;#x27;t satisfied with the President of the U.S. not handing him the investigation because U.S. citizens were threatened. Is this what happened in Ukraine? Is it entirely you that was involved in this criminal enterprise when your client was charged?</p>
