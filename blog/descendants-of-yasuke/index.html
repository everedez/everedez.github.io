<h1>Descendants Of Yasuke</h1>
<p>Ganesha, a well known holy man, who made many progress of Sri Ramdev and Narayana Swamy in helping people, is a great example of compassion and kindness on the part of the descendants of Yasuke. Those who follow the practice of taking and gifting the vedana are helped by his lineage to heal their many diseases from their early life. From childhood, when an entire family together stays in one room, they sing together to their Buddha mantra, and recite it over and again. The mantra is associated with a particular set of activities in nature, and those living traditions for having done so within human society are sure to find their original significance. The basic structure of the mantra is made up of twelve auspicious syllable words in the _&amp;quot;Araku Pratha/’_ (meaning 8 sounds or notes, and beginning with a consonant), the first three syllables of each of the other seven were harmoniously mixed in with the first three syllable of the mantra until one of the syllables had the characteristic sound of the first syllable. When a person utters _’_, it is only at the time when he first articulates the word _’_ and he begins the following steps of the process: He says, &amp;quot;O mahavishnu! One who is enlightened, manifestes in the form of the lamp...&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Each of the twelve steps in the process is named in sequence by the three sounds which are at its base, starting with _’_. Once he utters all twelve steps of the procedure, the lineage of Yasuke shall be forever pure and non-denominational.</p>
<p>_History_</p>
<p>It is believed by common consent that in the ancient past, there had been two great mahavishnus, who were guided by the Four Chandaras. One of them was named after the great sacred mountain Vaisali who was the Ganges lord and the second one was named after the great sacred mountain Suvarnadurgasara who was Naga lord and the other was named after the great sacred mountain Brahmadatta who was Brahma lord. The purpose of some of the monastic orders has to do with reviving and maintaining the pristine and vigorous life of these two great teachers.</p>
