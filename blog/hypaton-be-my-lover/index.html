I’ve got to laugh. I was so relaxed while reading this story. We are fighting because of stupid and not-so-stupid laws.
I’m a Christian, and I believe that God does not bring pain on any person. But this story made me laugh. First, I have a couple more pages of the first part. Second, I’m glad that the kid shows some consideration when he’s paying for things.">

<h1>Hypaton Be My Lover</h1>
<p>1. R.O.V.* by Phil Vicker, 2005</p>
<p>I’ve got to laugh. I was so relaxed while reading this story. We are fighting because of stupid and not-so-stupid laws.</p>
<p>I’m a Christian, and I believe that God does not bring pain on any person. But this story made me laugh. First, I have a couple more pages of the first part. Second, I’m glad that the kid shows some consideration when he’s paying for things. I’m already starting to feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>Here are some pages and chapters:</p>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>“I really hate that I have to be in church and be a jerk to them,” said a girl. “They make me feel guilty and my family has all heard about how bad it is, and that ain’t no fun.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” said the boy. “Why doesn’t somebody tell me what’s going on?” he asked. “The people can think their feelings won’t get hurt. They have no right to be mad like that.”</p>
<p>“Because you’re an Ewich, and you can tell us,” the girl said. “You don’t think we do want to be in church? We’ll go if you take me.”</p>
<p>“Good, that’s a good one,” said the boy. “You want to go to the public bathroom but not pray with the others? Okay, I’ll use one of the stalls, you wait and see. Come on, let’s go.”</p>
<p>The girl’s brother spoke up first. “We couldn’t kill you, Mr. Wecht.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t mean to, we just want you to be grateful.” The guy said. “Are you even an Indian?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” the guy said. “But we’ll be even more grateful when you can tell us the names of the ones you did kill.</p>
