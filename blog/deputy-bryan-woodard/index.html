<h1>Deputy Bryan Woodard</h1>
<p>At this point, it’s best to go through each piece that appears in Issue #1 of Halo 5: Guardians – this is necessary, since there is a lot of stuff that was in the Collector Pack, but the majority of it is in the expanded Collector’s Edition, which gives you your extra goodies, including another alternate-universe reference, the Halo 5: Guardians Companion ‘Fight Book,’ an original comic book and exclusive sketches. Read on.</p>
<h2>Badassitude</h2>
<p>The ‘Fighting for Fungi,’ or “Fight for Fungal,” book is an attempt to create a real-life version of the Halo comic. It’s not for kids, and not necessarily for adults, either. It has been done for games and books before, so it has the potential to work with the Halo comics. The end result has some cool drawings from two years ago. The problem with this book is that fans of the fighting stories will want to pull out their Microsoft PowerPoint and the reference section will not give them the information they need to make the best use of it.</p>
<p>These are the story pages from the book “Fighting For Fungal,” which is published by Titan Books. It is a graphic story, and written after the game development team investigated how and why players of a particular setting think certain characters fight in ways that enhance the fun and excitement of the game. It’s not a true fighting comic. For example, in its development, the real-life Fighting For Fungal book mentions Wrecking Ball, Combat Reflexes, Soldier of Fortune and other recent books as references, but they do not serve as real-life references.</p>
<p>Fight for Fungal is an artifact of the real world of gaming. Though its content is often misattributed, the book is available online, and is probably being looked at for future properties as well. These concepts are not easy (at least for a game creator) to understand, and even if you could get these references, the references have to be rooted and measured.</p>
<p>My first attempt at creating a Fighting For Fungal set from the game “Battle for Fungal” was a giant mess of a mess, with many references that could have benefited from proper research.</p>
