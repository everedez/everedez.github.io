<p>The trial date for Jacob Edgar Wolfe and all the other defendants in the court case and now into sentencing has been postponed until the end of November.</p>
<p>Conviction Update: On the issue of whether Jeff Lewis would file an appeal of the conviction at this juncture. A status conference has been scheduled on Thursday, November 11th to see if Jeff files an appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin. Some parties to the case might want to make sure that there is an appeal process for Wolfe. The case is set for the Law Office of John J. Veltri, et al.; court, 2016-Ohio-1881, 10:15 a.m. Opening statements are Tuesday, November 12th and sentencing is to be either Monday, November 15th or Tuesday, November 16th. Please stay tuned as we get closer.</p>
<p>A trial date for Jacob Edgar Wolfe and all the other defendants in the court case now into sentencing has been postponed until the end of November. Conviction Update: Jeff Lewis will file an appeal.</p>
<p>If Jacob Edgar Wolfe had his own home state residence and the same attorney represented him all along, this would not constitute a reversal of conviction. The court of public opinions as well as the majority at the appeal level says that he waived his issues that were forfeited. If he did not waive them because he does not feel the constitution protects them he would have the right to challenge it in the supreme court of the State. This is especially true for issues on DNA and lien waiver, the fact that we never heard from the government. Iâ€™ve had a few people object to my opinion in this matter as I have looked at this to object to the last 20 years of judicial service by somebody in this position of trust.</p>
<p>Recently, in our special news-show on January 7th, 2016 (The day of the jury verdict and sentence), a number of topics discussed and discussed particularly involving the crime of murder in the 2nd degree.</p>
<p>There were three different opinions in the majority opinion involving three different issues. I believe three different opinions is a substantial amount of the news that has been received. The jury did not find that Jeff Lewis killed Matthew Fitzgerald and two other fellow students and the district court overruled the defense arguments that his assistance was necessary to avert the imminent death penalty for Matthew Fitzgerald and two other individuals in the case.</p>
