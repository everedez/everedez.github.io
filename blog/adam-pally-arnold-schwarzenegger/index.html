<h1>Adam Pally Arnold Schwarzenegger</h1>
<h3>[Updated] By: Kacey Dunlap | Comments Off</h3>
<p>Steve Bannon and Chris Christie have been feuding for some time. Mostly, the two camps were criticizing the other for something or other. Now, the feud has gotten violent and could bring one of the biggest political surprises of this year — if only they could agree to actually call the thing off.</p>
<p>[Original post]</p>
<p>On December 18th, John Bolton, a senior adviser to President Trump, told a Wall Street Journal reporter, “His White House is a mess and he won’t get a job from me.” The obvious question that everyone seems to be asking is, “So what?”</p>
<p>The supposed response is one that is being heard with greater frequency. Senator Mitch McConnell is telling the Senate he will make his offer, it won’t include Steve King. Meanwhile, some Republicans aren’t picking up their phones.</p>
<p>One of the people doing the picking up is Dan Riehl, a conservative provocateur who recently, with the Trump campaign, set up a phony podcast, Breitbart, called “The Potty Mouth,” so as to draw attention to Trump’s potentially problematic behavior.</p>
<p>D-Ro is a conspiracy theorist extraordinaire who recently put out a book that calls for running a second Republican primary against Ted Cruz in Iowa. Then he recruited Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, one of the leading Trumpistas.</p>
<p>Riehl first laid the groundwork. Five days earlier, he set up an ad that read, “Senator Ted Cruz needs to announce today his support for the abolition of the Federal Reserve System.” It was supposed to be part of a small, low-budget campaign effort to confuse potential voters about Cruz’s plans. He created a recording of what he called a conservative policy committee meeting about fiscal matters. As a result, the advertisement was referred to as “The Cruz Plan.”</p>
<p>By now, it’s become a signature attack against Cruz. So, what’s happening here? Well, the Breitbart team doesn’t play games with what they say. They play to the nitty-gritty of what Breitbart’s team said.</p>
