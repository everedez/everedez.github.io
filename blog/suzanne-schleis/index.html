<p>Latest news update: &amp;quot;Despite that, we&amp;#x27;ve successfully isolated the agent, and that agent is a member of The Guild, a private organization specializing in espionage and infiltration by high-level government operatives. The Guild is seeking his retaliation.&amp;quot; - The Guild is looking for a scapegoat, the Guild President, Anselm &amp;#x27;Ali&amp;#x27; Zimmerman, has been found dead in a C&amp;#x27;n&amp;#x27;C nightclub in Spain.

<p>Amid a disturbing and still growing narrative in the United States that the United States government has employed - or is attempting to employ - the private security firms known to operate in Colombia called Los Mambises, an actual representative of The Guild, aka the CIA, has been found dead in an undisclosed location in Spain. According to The Daily Telegraph, the Guild is conducting an inquiry into the cause of death, as they currently have no leads in the matter, stating, &amp;quot;Police are trying to find out if the Guild who is investigating the cause of death will request his extradition to the US to face charges. However as the police are investigating there could be more questions that are surrounding the death.&amp;quot; The Guild president is Anselm “Ali” Zimmerman, currently (Apr 13) in Spain, having met with a representative of the Guild to discuss the investigation into this matter as well as a contract between the Guild and La Cataratas, the Spanish intelligence agency. Additionally, the Guild also is in contact with the Spanish government, which is looking into the issue as well to ensure that the Guild doesn’t receive further retribution for their part in the incident. Anselm Zimmerman had just finished a mission to the Dominican Republic to pass information on to their US counterparts and specifically regarding the matter involving The Guild and their own contracts with La Cataratas, which started to sour in late February after they recently were shown to have been caught rigging up the Colombian intelligence agency and sending false information to La Cataratas. La Cataratas had also given the Guild the go-ahead to be a target of the CIA, in addition to La Cataratas’ sister organization El Deporte and their sub-organization Los Infractores.</p>
