<h1>Ronald Tolbert Investigation</h1>
<p>He was unable to sleep on the other side of the bed and was disturbed by a noise in the hall. His friend, Gary, was in his early thirties and not having any close friends, had found this strange. When Gary opened the door the light from the lamp that was shining through the letter box was dim and seemed to scare Mr. Tolbert.</p>
<p>“What is it you’re actually afraid of Mr. Tolbert?” he asked anxiously. Gary pushed him gently back against the wall and Gary went to the receiver to call the police. After a few minutes, he returned with the police.</p>
<p>“The police are on their way”, he whispered in Mr. Tolbert’s ear. “You know we can stay the night and tomorrow he comes over and we tell him what we need,” he said confidently. Mr. Tolbert did not reply immediately. It took some time to coax him out of his funk. He sat down heavily on a chair and stared into the fireplace.</p>
<p>“Gosh, it doesn’t seem like anything has happened,” he exclaimed. “Gary, would you go and get a bottle of Scotch from the kitchen and give it to me. I need to put some of this whisky from the cellar up to this house. I want to make an announcement.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute”, said Gary as he came back into the hall. “I’m sorry. I don’t think you know that I’m at an important meeting”.</p>
<p>Mr. Tolbert looked quite bewildered. He looked up confusedly to see Gary putting down the bottle of whisky and looked back at the telephone. Gary leaned over slightly while he spoke and the light from the lamp glinted off the lenses of his contact lenses.</p>
<p>“It’s all right”, said Mr. Tolbert, “I know it doesn’t say very many details, but I want you to have it. There is a bit of news that would be a great help”. Mr. Tolbert did not reply immediately. After some effort Gary stopped his efforts, he turned to him and said, “There is a charge being brought by a man in Australia, he is called Ronald Tolbert.</p>
