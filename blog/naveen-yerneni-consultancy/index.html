<h1>Naveen Yerneni Consultancy</h1>
<p>Naveen Yerneni is at the forefront of the UAE Government’s drive to explore all the avenues of electronic health records. His knowledge about the unique system they are building in the USA and being driven by his innovation drive in developing biometric technologies, has led Naveen to get closer to doctors and pharmacists with his hands-on approach to collaboration.</p>
<p>He leverages the assets of both a US based academic and a CEO who is developing a disruptive, nationally-backed biometric system.</p>
<p>In his talks Naveen explains the problems patients are facing and it’s up to us to guide them, since most people don’t even understand what a biometric license is. He also shares some of the challenges ahead, how biometric systems can be used and the way to run a healthcare IT company. Some of the issues discussed are: managing costs, competitive models, making sure someone can take credit for an innovation and most of all solving the problem of accessing doctors when they have reservations about a biometric technology.

<p>Naveen Yerneni is at the forefront of the UAE Government’s drive to explore all the avenues of electronic health records. With the UAE Government spearheading the adoption of biometric information systems, Naveen, one of his colleagues and a UAE-based “dream team”, has been given the task of developing the next game-changer in the digital healthcare environment. In an initiative to create the Nation’s Technology Hub, the technology will be housed in the Technology University. “This initiative will be conducted in support of the President’s Vision to create a friendly environment and advanced economy,” explains Naveen.</p>
<p>Although biometrics plays a more prominent role in the UAE society, and the Healthcare industry in general nowadays, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Because of the huge financial clout of the Middle East and the relatively small number of healthcare professionals in the entire region, the UAE has unique capabilities.</p>
