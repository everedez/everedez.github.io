<h1>The Snl Sketch That Perfectly Mocks</h1>
<p>The Internet is awash with satirical comedy material which manages to be both hilarious and insightful, but the same can’t be said for the content of Snl. Snl is a satire of the American National Football League satirised in depth by Snl Writer Hype. The best example of this is the “Snap the Poke” episode wherein NFL officials issue a white piece of paper with the signatures of the players on it as the decoys to the touchdowns in order to achieve a single point spread. This became yet another iconic comic satire on the NFL. For years, that entire team has been the subject of a fairly brilliant comedy series which Hype has now left to do his own thing. I’d like to see another popular American show get it’s own attempt at a parody.</p>
<p>Some links to comedy sites:</p>
<p>
That episode of Snl was satire of the American National Football League? Too funny<br>
Why do the team names ring a bell? Like this sketch back in April.<br>
Hype has a great podcast called Little Britain. The episode this article is about isn’t for some reason.<br>
</p>
<p>[Possibly relevant is the scene from the recent Broadway musical “The Lion King.” It shows a high school marching band in attendance. At one point, the bandleader is trying to communicate from the side of the stage to a girl who’s not paying attention.]</p>
<p>A recent SNL has a memorable song called The Lively Ones who, like Snl, is based on the National Football League. This clip has become one of the signature episodes for the show.</p>
<p>Here’s another clip that’s very much related to “The Lion King”.</p>
<p>What is all this stuff that Snl, and a bunch of other sites, have been going on about? It’s basically “Team of the Week” columns, and the team that’s drawing the most laughs is supposedly the team that is the butt of the joke or whatever.</p>
<p>Many have told me that it’s just another syndicated radio show which everybody loves, so I found this great image from Wikipedia which shows a football game at UCLA.</p>
