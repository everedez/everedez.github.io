Hereinafter referred to as “USGIA”, the foregoing represents part of the public domain.<br>
“Public domain” is defined as: “Created and owned by the American people as<br>
freedom of information.” Government has to treat public domain information on the<br>
same terms as public domain material, but in a more definitive way. Public domain<br>
is usually treated as available for everyone to use freely. For example, you can read<br>
any article from any source for FREE on the internet. There are always going to be<br>
sites where only paid content is available, often at a price that is the same.<br>
Public domain material is available for free use, however, not without paying for<br>
the privilege. No government entity has gone to the trouble and expense of establishing<br>
a long-term public domain policy. Governments are controlled by the people, not by the<br>
media, and they work so hard to keep people from getting information that they forget<br>
that most people want, and in fact a great deal of material, from the public domain.<br>
Wikipedia is an example of public domain work. The site cannot be used for paid<br>
research, but everyone wants to use public domain information, and there is always<br>
the possibility that a copy will be made if something is worth the trouble. “Paid<br>
research” means a lot of money for the research. It generally includes hiring a few<br>
people full-time to work on a few tasks that seem important, since pay may not<br>
always be enough to support research effort. No budget is put aside for paid<br>
research. The only research effort is expended by someone who makes a living<br>
saying that they need the research. Unless funding is established it is almost<br>
certain that the investigation will go nowhere.<br>
