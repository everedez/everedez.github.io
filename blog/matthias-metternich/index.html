<h1>Matthias Metternich</h1>
<h3>Political Affiliations:</h3>
<p>• Member of the European Parliament&amp;#x27;s Committee on Industry, Research, Creative Industries, External Trade, Energy and Natural Resources (COM(1999) 593)</p>
<p>• Member of the Foreign Affairs Group (with the responsibility to seek out, protect and promote the free movement of people and services by EU Member States)</p>
<h2>Major Ophthalmic Projects:</h2>
<p>
• New and original, state-of-the-art equipment has become available to a broad spectrum of ophthalmic clinical departments, thus facilitating studies of retinal diseases in human and animal eyes as well as in tissue culture.<br>
• The Department of Ophthalmology is committed to providing the widest variety of clinical services for special cases. Ophthalmologists work within this environment offering a competent, qualified and skillful ophthalmic staff that will be able to provide a reliable surgical and non-surgical treatment programme for retinal and related diseases.<br>
• There is currently one medical officer in-practice for the department at the ophthalmology ward, which provides a medical service that is particularly effective.<br>
• The Department of Ophthalmology has recruited four more staff: a consultant and two clinical officers. Two of the clinical officers are urologists and there are two other medical officers in-practice to provide a combined service of urology and ophthalmology. The recruitment is part of the efforts of the department to fulfil the need to supplement medical ophthalmological services with several other specialist services.<br>
• The department has a new building for a new facility in Frankfurt and there is an extensive research programme and infrastructure requirements, including a new workshop for advanced technology. There will be a 2-bedded surgical operating room, including a 30’ x 16’ operating theatre that is intended for high risks.<br>
• At present there are five ophthalmic patients who are referred to the department, which is indicated by the fact that the clinic sees approximately 3-4 new patients a month in terms of patients coming to see ophthalmologists.<br>
• A maximum of two patients or a proportion not exceeding 20 per month and who is by one of the local eye hospitals will come to view the ophthalmological records and photographs and periscope of the eye from their own home via the internet.<br>
