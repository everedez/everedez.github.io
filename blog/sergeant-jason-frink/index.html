<h1>Sergeant Jason Frink</h1>
<h3>Deputy Sheriff</h3>
<p>Sgt. Jason Frink was executed by Stateville Prison officials before federal district court Judge Jean Lefkowke for the charge of possession of marijuana. During the hearing, the evidence will be presented to Frink’s co-defendants, the third defendant in the case, Jenson Cerrone.</p>

</p>
<p>Stateville Special Agent Brice Freis made clear on Tuesday, 5/13/16, that he “has reached out to the police department and to the district attorneys” as part of some “initial review,” to “make sure we’re all on the same page as far as what’s expected.”</p>
<p>Other officer-involved shooting injuries</p>
<p>Of course, there have been other shootings by police where they killed innocent people, but Frink was acting as a Deputy Sheriff at that moment and he was one of the wrong people.</p>
<p>Cleaning the crime scene</p>
<p>Stateville police made sure that there were always nice touchers.</p>
