<h1>Rito Vetiver Soap</h1>
<p>We are talking about a moisturizing soap. This is one of the reasons for our popularity as a cosmetic and other natural health products.</p>
<p>If you haven&amp;#x27;t heard about Rito Vetiver, here&amp;#x27;s the deal: Vetiver is a blackcurrant extract and it can be used at once as an essential oil, in a water base for soaps and mouthwashes, or as a shampoo. While in those forms of use it can still help with dry and irritated skin. This extract is derived from the dried roots and flowers of the flowering plant African Vermillion Cobra. The roots and flowers were collected by Victor Hugo, one of the 19th century&amp;#x27;s biggest flower peddlers. It has been around for sometime and is now considered an astringent.</p>
<p>Ritasilk has recently launched a line of Natural Beauty soaps in their signature drops. If you&amp;#x27;re looking for something different from the usual soaps, this is a good one to check out. I am looking forward to trying it out!</p>
<h2>Rito Vetiver Soap</h2>
<h3>Commercial Grade Product:</h3>
<p>This is the best of the three. I donâ€™t recommend using this product in combination with others. To test the drops for toxicity against skin (for skin toxicity testing), please be aware that you must be careful to avoid rubbing on skin or even coming in contact while applying the soap. Rito Vetiver is toxic - even at a very low dose, when used on skin on contact with skin it should not only go off, but it should stay off.</p>
<p>I have discovered that Rito Vetiver Soap has numerous ingredients that I had never or haven&amp;#x27;t learned about before (for example, Vitamin C drops) and the drops did not work how the commercials portrayed them to. I have also found out this is a plant extract and there seem to be several side effects that I do not know about.</p>
<h2>Cost:</h2>
<p>According to the latest survey reports by the Hemp Alternative UK webpage, Rito Vetiver has to be used at least 3 times in a month and each preparation period of a period of 12 weeks. That said, these are the two things I can get around by and do easily. One is from my natural health products collection. The other is being used as a shampoo (mix 1 part Rito Vetiver into 1 part water for an effective two part mixture).</p>
