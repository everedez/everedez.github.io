So let&amp;#x27;s talk about these first. Why are they not labeled?
Ahh, they are all closed by the side of the road. Those little orange posts I guess.
This is a good map, but they ruin the look of the map.

This game in which one side of map is side, and the other map is main is a great example of the kind of &amp;quot;toy map&amp;quot; that is very common in TMT.">

<p>This game in which one side of map is side, and the other map is main is a great example of the kind of &amp;quot;toy map&amp;quot; that is very common in TMT. It&amp;#x27;s not particularly cool, but it&amp;#x27;s the kind of thing that gets people talking and talking.</p>
<p>The map is a street map of the street that I called Market in my article. It&amp;#x27;s made of plastic, and on the front (as you can see) there&amp;#x27;s a name that appears: San Francisco is not some weird place. It&amp;#x27;s basically called Market. It&amp;#x27;s a spot where you can purchase a lot of things. The plastic is real. It&amp;#x27;s all just tots. No-one would expect it to be real, but it was sold. And it&amp;#x27;s real! As you can imagine, that&amp;#x27;s what you have to think of when you&amp;#x27;re thinking &amp;quot;Why do I have to fight with these guys for maps?&amp;quot;</p>

<p>*Please note that these are not a canonical version of the game, as I&amp;#x27;ve only attempted to fill in the last few points and addresses. Also, some of the info above is out of date and inaccurate.*</p>
<p>Here are the real origins of this map:</p>

They could be even worse than &amp;quot;faux rocks&amp;quot; like it is in the above example, but at least they are real.<br>

I took it from this map which is on the Google Maps site: http://gromarish.<br>
