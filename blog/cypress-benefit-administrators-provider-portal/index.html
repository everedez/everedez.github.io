<h1>Cypress Benefit Administrators Provider Portal</h1>
<p>Cypress&amp;#x27; API is one of the best way to get started with easy</p>
<p>Cypress is a new feature with third parties like EnterpriseFoundry OpenStack, AppDynamics, and Canonical. It provides a way for you to easily integrate an application or product in a browser or in native. Cypress leverages an API in order to allow people to work very quickly and very efficiently. The cRaft web-based API is useful for both API developers and API managers so that every developer should have the ability to create great applications.</p>
<p>Enrollments with Cypress are pretty simple, you simply ask for a new project using the http prefix with the &amp;#x27;Cypress&amp;#x27;:</p>
<p>Example: cypress deploy post create</p>
<p>Post deploy request</p>
<p>There are three examples you can use :</p>
<p>
Cypress validates your file and gives back an E-Mail with the error string, your error message, or a warning.<br>
Cypress checks for your old version of the API. No matter if the file was created on or off.<br>
Cypress builds a signed binary, that might be run, converted for testing, or more.<br>
How do I Use Cypress?<br>
Migrate as needed using the user story provided by Cypress&amp;#x27;s API.<br>
</p>
<p>In order to use the API to your advantage, you must use one of the examples provided by the project. Refer to the Cypress API tutorial (L3-transition), as it explains how to do this.</p>
<p>Using the API (http://localhost:8080/accounts ) to register another application that was migrated from another service. A very intuitive way to manage accounts.</p>
<p>
The administrator and user registration page (https://localhost:7474/), where the API accepts API requests<br>
All the accounts for the cRaft service are listed when entering your new application.<br>
E-Mail validation<br>
</p>
<p>Once the system has a project, you will usually have a lot of free time to spend looking at the local resources to get used to use from the development point of view and to look for new ways of using Cypress. To that, the service does not offer much to do right now in terms of features / integrations. It does not offer any possibility to sign in with Cypress and get your project registered.</p>
