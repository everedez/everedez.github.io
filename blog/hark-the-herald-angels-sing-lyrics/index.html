<h1>Hark The Herald Angels Sing Lyrics</h1>
<p>
&amp;quot;When I was young, I played the lute and sang the lyre,<br>
Yet I never lost hope, for in song I still travelled,<br>
Now I hope that I still travel,<br>
And in the dawn, I also hope to travel.<br>
From &amp;quot;The Lighthouse at Sea&amp;quot;<br>
When I was young, I played the lute and sang the lyre,<br>
Yet I never lost hope, for in song I still travelled,<br>
Now I hope that I still travel,<br>
And in the dawn, I also hope to travel.<br>
O God, I pray for you;<br>
Come and save me, let your gracious light shine upon me.<br>
Father, when I am dead, Lord, take me to your bosom.<br>
In the darkness of this shore I will sing your sweet song.<br>
All the fields I see, the fields shall be my home,<br>
For I will hide myself in the depths of the sea.<br>
All the world in sight to you,<br>
As the blue of the sky and the azure of the skies<br>
Even as they go, let them go and go.<br>
O God, fill me with happiness<br>
That I may make it mine and I will so gladly have it.<br>
How I came from this heart of mine<br>
My hopes and my desires are so low to see.<br>
All the fields I see, the fields shall be my home,<br>
For I will hide myself in the depths of the sea.<br>
All the world in sight to you,<br>
As the blue of the sky and the azure of the skies,<br>
Even as they go, let them go and go.<br>
Lord, shine your splendor on me,<br>
And let your heaven I see,<br>
For though the life of me fades away, the life of<br>
my little girl will live forever and ever.<br>
</p>
