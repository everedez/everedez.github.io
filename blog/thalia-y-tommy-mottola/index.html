<h1>Thalia Y Tommy Mottola</h1>
<p>The owner of a British supermarket chain was jailed for five years for trading on his sex with young girls he caught holding secret meetings in his back garden with two men he &amp;quot;supposedly found attractive&amp;quot;. The 23-year-old, who was convicted of five offences under the Sex Offences Act, also made a £45,000 payment into bank accounts linked to the site where the scheme was uncovered.</p>
<p>David Cameron vowed to rejail Mr Mottola - a successful solicitor from Finsbury Park, north London - within the next four years.</p>
<p>After he had offered three girls, just 11 at the time, a £250 cash payment but with no promise of sexual relationship, he caught the two men entwining their hands together in his back garden under the direction of two prostitutes, who were used to carry out the offences.</p>
<p>Mr Mottola had been approached by two women, whose ages approximated his own, both aged 18-24, on a short-term contract. He travelled with them to a house on a street in Sadiq Khan Close, Strand, east London, near Victoria Embankment, to meet them in secret.</p>
<p>Mr Mottola, who worked for an international law firm, confessed that some of the &amp;quot;potential customers&amp;quot; were &amp;quot;not the sort he typically meets&amp;quot;. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, two men, known only as A and B, were &amp;quot;involved in a relationship and were due to meet a girl&amp;quot; in his back garden on May 6, 2012. &amp;quot;Mack and Daniel believed they were friends with Mr A&amp;quot;, she added, adding that &amp;quot;there was a possibility that they saw each other very often and this led them to think there was a significant chance of meeting others&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>The prospect of having contact with a woman of the same age as he was was inappropriate, and, according to the court, &amp;quot;proved too much for either of the defendants&amp;quot;. Mr Mottola had offered more than £250 to send one of the women to visit him for sex. &amp;quot;They had been in touch before, but this was the first time they were together for more than a few hours,&amp;quot; he said.</p>
