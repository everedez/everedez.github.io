<h1>Kenmore Grill Burners</h1>
<p>Burner designs from the 1960s and 1970s include the Kollmorgenswärtsbrite, the Fliesswärtsbrite, and the Elbertsbrite. Original modern burners from 1959 have included the Kollmersen, and the Kollmorgsen bimonthly. The Elbertsbrite is another modern interpretation of the traditional stove style. Models from the 1970s were designed by Otto Spillhorn, Herman Schnitzer, and Raimund Niemann.</p>

<p>Other products were designed and built: two Kollmers and several Elbertsbrenntrades, but they only started to appear in the 1970s. This custom feature of this kind of burners was highly valued since the 1950s, but as a rule they weren&amp;#x27;t very well known, and consequently they were unavailable to a lot of German disc golfers since early on. As a rule, these burners with their clever disc design would be sold under other names — also to the disc golf world. Every burner of the type without a separate name has the additional characteristic that every disc that touches it releases a small gust of air when the disc passes over it.</p>
<p>Most of these burners have the disc that touches them just barely, so that they meet that delicate, self-cleaning design and achieve a very high speed in flight. The disc typically flies above the burner with a small gust of air.</p>
<p>After about twenty years of successful use, it became clear that these burners that produced low aerodynamically at normal conditions and high speeds, were relatively easy to put together. They are made out of a single cast aluminum sheet, which features the entire face of the burner. The construction is very secure, as well: Even an oversized disc that runs out through the top is easily rolled down into the burner. In order to eliminate mistakes, they have also been cleaned to a high standard.</p>
