<h1>Casio Exilim 5x</h1>
<h3>The “BIG DAY-A-MONTH” DISNEY GIRLFRIEND POP-UP</h3>
<p>Thank-you to all of you who subscribed or renewed over the past month! Please continue to check back on my blog here to see all of the new items in our line-up and to see if I’ll be posting any new images of products or projects we’ve been working on while at Disney!</p>
<p>I’ll be bringing back some items I have already photographed and we’ve also had a few surprises in the works. If you miss me, I’ll be back with new items in a few weeks! I’m currently just in Disney Springs and couldn’t be there more than a few days a month! I’ll be back soon with a new offering for the entire month… for now, have a great evening!</p>
<p>Please share, Tweet, Facebook, Google+ and Snail Mail for the most recent Disney Spring Design and Special Promos! It’s never too soon to come together!</p>
<p>As always, The Comic Shop is the leading source for Disney Comic Art and Modern Art here at the Disney Store. Many years I’ve waited for them to get out with something as classic as the Star Wars Collectible figurine. Here’s a display of their most recent creation. I’m sure this is just the beginning of a bigger hall or display at the Disney Store, and when I’m working on a huge project this summer I’m sure The Comic Shop will be there with my latest or even just one or two new pieces. I’ll blog here and on the Disney Blog regularly and hope you’ll stay tuned for new products and glimpses of past or current Disney Specials.</p>
<p>Also, our very own original art, comics, illustrations and graphic novels is now available for sale at the Disney Store at all participating stores in the U.S. Once you acquire a copy of this newest reprint I am certain you will understand why it is the greatest piece of the Collectable Comics Series.</p>
<p>Please keep this site updated and we hope to see you soon! My motto is “Always Have a Little Fun” which makes this blog the greatest.</p>
