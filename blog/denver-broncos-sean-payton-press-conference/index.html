<h1>Denver Broncos Sean Payton Press Conference</h1>
<p>First let me just say that the media world has done such a fantastic job and this year they even put out the article on Broncos cut utility back, Jeff Kemp. My friend Richard Sellers from the Denver Post is no slouch when it comes to player interviews. I heard a good bit from him as a beat writer. Now let me get into it with NFL Films, what I am interested to see is what Sean Payton has seen from the game he coaches. Let’s see if it translates.</p>
<p>Sean Payton as Coach, What’s his expectations?</p>
<p>Q: What are Payton’s expectations during his next six games?</p>
<p>SP: Well, I don’t know exactly. We’re the preseason coach; I don’t know what we should be thinking during those six games. I have to go and see the guys before the game. You just don’t have those type of numbers if you don’t play. But on ‘Game of Thrones,’ it said that you had to really try and carry through. I have to go out there and see how they think in the game, but what I’ve seen so far from everything we’ve seen since the first couple of weeks, I really think that we have good goals, and I think that our goals are to have a winning record during the regular season. We have got some bigger goals out there; we have to take care of our own. We’ve got to do something special in the playoffs to get us back to where we were last year.</p>
<p>Q: There are also those rumors of working with a former boss again this year. So how much interaction do you get with Sean Payton?</p>
<p>SP: I don’t know all that. I’ve not heard anything about that and I’m not going to talk about it unless I hear something differently and the end game I would like to win a Super Bowl with him. I think it’s a good thing if you can end up working with him. I think it’s good for the league to have coaches from past times. So we’ll probably have a discussion about it in the future, but not that we’ve ever had.</p>
