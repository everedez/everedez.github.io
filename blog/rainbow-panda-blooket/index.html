<h1>Rainbow Panda Blooket</h1>
<p>Finally our newest product is finally up for sale for all the early bird hunters out there! A year-long free promotion during Christmas rush that will last for 4 straight days! With only 5 free orders! Includes a free holiday banner, balloon kit, and 4 other 4-pack orders.</p>
<p>
5 free orders.<br>
Less than 5 orders. (Trial) and a year-long free promotional offer!<br>

<p>While we normally cater to major promotions and new items with a massive discount for one year and a free shipping promotion such as we have just offered this one won’t run without at least 2 to 3 other companies out there offering deals of their own but this one can actually last all year!</p>
<p>This is a huge discount to the full price of our entire line of products except the decals. These 3 basic packs of each shade of Rainbow Polaroid will literally run you $30 for a full frame. Yes, it’s true!</p>
<p>However, the decal packs will be similar in price, $10 a piece with the 3 basic packs. We will also have in stock other items such as decals, items that may run you $20 a piece or better, and we’re also willing to forgo any promotion or discount we may give to other companies.</p>
<p>It should come as no huge surprise to fans that this deal runs out to Midnight on December 1st and stays open until midnight at the latest.</p>
<p>Now, with the 2016 Christmas rush on, what to do? The decals, the paint, and the other products are most definitely run out, but we’re also willing to forgo the discount we may give to other companies.</p>
<p>There have been many posts recently claiming that it hasn’t been possible to create decals without resorting to standard framing. But it’s true! With the changes that have been made for this year, we’ve found ourselves having to resort to this even more recently.</p>
<p>We’ve been working with this technique for many years now and I believe that this technique is greatly improved, making it easier for us as artists on the outside, but much more challenging for us as artists on the inside.</p>
