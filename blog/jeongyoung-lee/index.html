<h1>Jeongyoung Lee</h1>
<p>Pushed into a battle with his own blood?</p>
<p>It hasn’t been the deadliest of times for Jeongyoung Lee, but if he and his teammates can make it through a fair fight, there is reason for hope that he could become a player capable of going out there and crushing opponents on both sides of the ball.</p>
<p>The four-time Olympic gold medalist, South Korea’s most decorated, 2012 Olympic silver medalist, Jeongyoung Lee heads into the 2012 Olympics with more than 30 years of experience, but is still only 21 years of age. The veteran guard, who had previously played for the Dallas Cowboys, the Los Angeles Toreros, and the Los Angeles Quakes, is itching to break out on the international stage.</p>
<p>That’s good for Lee as he can begin earning significant playing opportunities through international play while also maintaining his current status as a Texas Longhorn.</p>
<p>Through seven NFL seasons for the Arizona Cardinals, he has made a name for himself as one of the league’s top guards, but it may just be a matter of time until his name draws more fanfare. After playing just two games with the Cardinals during the 2002 season, Lee became a hidden prospect in the desert and has since been able to earn quite the following since entering the NFL as a second round pick in 2005.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Matt Schaub as the Houston Texans quarterback, Lee was an integral part of running the offense. Over his first seven seasons, the player accrued a record 89.85 yards per game, 29 touchdowns and just two interceptions. Over his eight years in the league from 2005-2010, Lee logged a record 232 combined tackles and achieved a career-high 107 tackles with six interceptions in 2009.</p>
<p>For his size, Lee is not the type of player that could face a power run game the way a corner does. However, after playing the run well for the Toreros late in his career, Lee has found himself in the spotlight as an offensive lineman for a number of teams, such as the Kansas City Chiefs in 2008.</p>
<p>“I’d been asked that question a bunch of times.</p>
