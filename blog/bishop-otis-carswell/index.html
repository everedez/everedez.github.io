<h1>Bishop Otis Carswell</h1>
<p>
In 1901, when he was sixteen years of age, Bryan went to New London,<br>
Connecticut. He was a boy of no serious education, who had never wished<br>
to take an interest in anything, but that he could just about manage to<br>
make the street through which he walked mean enough. Bryan had small<br>
anticipations about attending school, and even this did not, as it<br>
might, seem to have attracted the notice of those who educated him.<br>
At the first day of the school, which was taught by Mr. Chase, there<br>
was a paper which related to the studies of the dead, and these of the<br>
present, who must attend to the early history of the Indians and the<br>
Newcomers. The students listened with respectful attention, but some<br>
were absent-minded, and at last one of them spoke.<br>
“There was once a lady from Vermont,” said Bryan, “and she once sent<br>
a few books about her family, and this lady wrote down every one of<br>
them, and promised to keep them till we should be sent to New York,<br>
which isn’t so far as we would know, for we don’t know anything of the<br>
country. I think it is better now for her to keep what she has written,<br>
than for her to lose what I will read.”<br>
Bryan put his books down in a corner of the class-room, and got busy<br>
studying the objects for which they had been promised.<br>
All through one day he kept taking notes, making blots and other<br>
attempts of penmanship, but still there were blank pages of the same<br>
nature, with the old names there, of the past, of the present.<br>
At the very beginning of the first class Bryan had fallen in love with<br>
the idea of entering a merchant’s office. He was so long thinking of it,<br>
and not being able to see any way to put it before his mind, he gave no<br>
entertainment to the other students that term in Mr. Chase’s school.<br>
The youth from Connecticut went every other day to see his chum, and he<br>
made his friends growl that there is no room in the teacher’s office for<br>
Mr.<br>
