<h1>Abraxan Winged Horse</h1>
<p>Some say a horse, or an animal that resembles a horse has magical powers. Others believe that being the same type of horse will grant you protection and blessing. Some say that an antigravity mount will make your flight safer and a place between heaven and earth. A few say that the wind can carry you when you see it flying by and away from you, and that if you step out of line or wander too close to it you&amp;#x27;ll be hit by birds.</p>
<p>Whether you think it has wings or not, or you believe it to be a horse, or some other creature, the Antigravity Falconet is the perfect mount. What do you think about how this beast came to be?</p>
<p>A Brief Overview of the Antigravity Falconet</p>
<p>The term Antigravity began to take root in 1856 at the Second Reform Society for Animal Magnetism in London, created to study the supernatural powers of Magnetism (magnetism, a type of electricity). The Society was funded by a gold medal awarded to Sir Henry Parry, 1st Baron Parry, whose work was subsequently identified with Parry&amp;#x27;s Horse. Mr. H. H. Bell (1837 - 1916) was an Anglican clergyman, schoolteacher, and natural philosopher in London&amp;#x27;s East End. After looking into the nature of Magnetism, Bell created several displays that he claimed demonstrated magnetic power.</p>
<p>
However, as this article details, the true essence of what Bell was doing was to study horses.<br>
Enter the Antigravity Falconet.<br>
The Antigravity Falconet<br>
</p>
<p>In 1856, Bell began his experiments by attempting to describe how a creature would perform the feats attributed to a horse. Believing that horses had superior magnetism to humans, Bell decided to give a horse body-shape for testing. He created the shape of the Falcon (a falcon) by fusing together three wood blocks and peeling the layers of paper away from the surfaces. Bell believed it was true that by combining these three shapes into a single beast the Falcon could be made magnetic, possibly by the fact that one of the shapes of the Falcon could copy the shape of two other animals -- the shape being the equine antigravity mount.</p>
<p>According to Bell, the Falcon had superpowers.</p>
