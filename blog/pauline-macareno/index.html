<h1>Pauline Macareno</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Pauline Macareno (František, b. 1936) is a Czech novelist, biographer and a Polish national. Born and educated in Prague, she has had several years of training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In 1981 she was awarded the Order of Merit from the Polish government for her literary works and essay collections, in 1986 the Grand Tribute to those who died in the Warsaw Ghetto, in 1987 the Order of Charles III and in 1996 the Golden Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.</p>
<p>From 1992 through 1997 she lived in the City of Warsaw with her husband Daniel Zgoda (b. 1949), who had been a regular contributor of articles published by the Evening Primate of the Evangelical-Roman Catholic Church. On his death in 2004 Macareno co-wrote the memoir Les Belges d’Aran (Aran ’s Mountains, 2004), first published by Krim Duchy in French. Her books Die Litgar-Geschichten 1: Die Märchen Lili Marlene und Luther und and Die Litgar-Geschichten 2: Elrond und Galbatorix and Die Litgar-Geschichten 3: Wagner und David und Nebe und ängstliche Gedanken were published by Krim Duchy in English.</p>
<p>From 1981 her work was included in the anthologies Mały Bog Świat (1980), Witr Arystotelesn (1982, a.o. (With Barbara Wernicka)) and Wartelisten (1985), the Bibliotheca Hertziana (1994, with Charles Kedward and Philippe Kahn). Her first novel, Tor, I &amp;amp; II (1982, a.o., published in Great Britain, Finland, France, Denmark, Sweden; and 1983, in Czechoslovakia), about Czech children, inspired the creation of a children&amp;#x27;s program on TV, Krim-Kameleon. In 1982, she was a prose writer on TV channels Emmerick and Hundertwasser. The popular programme was entitled Tor, I. And II which, among other highlights, introduced Zdoba Młody (Lei Bäckerer, in Czech).</p>
