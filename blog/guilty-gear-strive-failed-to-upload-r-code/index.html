<h1>Guilty Gear Strive Failed To Upload R-code</h1>
<p>It appeared this morning that Konami&amp;#x27;s Guilty Gear Strive, a first-person peripheral and PlayStation 2 game that plays a critical part in the series, have missed an upload via Sony&amp;#x27;s server.</p>
<p>The file can be found over at the European PlayStation.Blog but the question is why does the software fail to deliver an official upload? This appears to be due to the fact that most PlayStation 3 update developers request an R-code to be uploaded so they can send a video demo on stage with the GameStop demo at an interview event.</p>
<p>While PlayStation 3 game developers never give the PS3 R-code or the R-code the development team requested unless a specific lead requires it, the fact that the uploading via PSN is not possible is making this trend of sticking a R-code up there look rather pointless. Considering that Japan&amp;#x27;s PlayStation Network is only capable of having 60 seconds of upload time. It&amp;#x27;s not good enough!</p>
<p>While Sony seem to be catching up on most of the game&amp;#x27;s content as the day wears on we do not yet know the title that will be released on the console. Hopefully, the Sony demo, as well as the last chapter of the saga be released with new content sometime in the future. We did learn in the Famitsu magazine that part of the story is being recoded to add a new weapon in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Until then we will just have to wait for more news and updates.</p>
<h2>In-Game Summary:</h2>
<p>Story: The creator of the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot;-Code (the code that appears on the GameStop demo showing gameplay footage) is faced with an insistent phone call asking him to create a true ending to the story. He decides not to waste his time trying to hack his way around the story, and instead places his energy into the true ending. Some months after being confronted by his fans, he sets up a recording device that will carry on his voice in the story via the phone call, where he promises that there will be a new ending.</p>
<p>After the final chapter of the r-code was placed into the game&amp;#x27;s files, the developer did the necessary work to finally finish the story. The &amp;quot;life&amp;quot; of the &amp;quot;R-Code&amp;quot; of course ended as it did before the last chapter, only she never was.</p>
