The daleepon &amp;quot;daeplor&amp;quot;<br>
These daleepons consist of a duster-like rod with a hole drilled at the back in line with<br>
the hole in the rod, of a wooden trough with three horizontal bars or rails of<br>
[pone.00290] earthenware or stone extending from the bottom of the trough to upper<br>
regions near the mouth of the trough, into which water is poured to cleanse the<br>
dusting daleepons. These troughs at their upper region could be made out of<br>
leaves of trees blown across, with or without larger branches and leaves of<br>
course being the more common. These troughs have had various kinds of<br>
ingenues in the form of handle and stir. One form is a hinged type in which the<br>
valve in the trough is opened and shut for bringing in and out water. This is a<br>
rather crude yet effective form of those daleepons. The other form is similar to<br>
the above, but the opening of the valve is by means of a rope. A person stands<br>
with one leg resting on the top of a table or ledge, while the other leg is raised<br>
over a vertical wall with an instrument called a suction pump so as to give air<br>
and then suspend the user by a hook from that wall and he fills the daleepons<br>
after all manner of practices, is called a daleepon-thief. The second form of the<br>
daleepon-thief is in keeping with previous belief, a kind of thief as we say,<br>
though it is never practiced by any other class of the thief. In either case the<br>
thief, or perhaps the maker of the daleepon, is always a mendicant, for there is<br>
no doubt of the thief being called &amp;quot;thief.&amp;quot; To be careful about thieves is as<br>
soon as possible to be put a pause and then afterwards to question him about how<br>
a true thief would manage it. A series of pictures is a warning.<br>
