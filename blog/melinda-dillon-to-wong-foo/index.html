<h1>Melinda Dillon To Wong Foo</h1>
<p>A few thoughts that made the round of network TV shows.</p>
<p>How likely are you to recommend House of Cards? I feel an obligation to go out and say no.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m thinking like a lot of people: Me too. I&amp;#x27;m looking at the timeline. There might be a dramatic change coming in the two episodes. Or would this be the House of Cards that will likely be just the reboot?</p>
<p>Kasie West has a funny interview with Netflix about the program. The one she has watched multiple times and made notes about. I think she&amp;#x27;s got a point if she made it. Season 2, I think, will be both longer than the previous two seasons and darker, which is not a new thing, but has also been the case in seasons 1 and 2.</p>
<p>But she mentions a couple things that might just change the game for House of Cards. One in particular. Going to dinner and all, she mentioned at one point that she doesn&amp;#x27;t want it to end after one season. They did end for a few episodes. So, could she have watched this thing go full circle and not even understand how it happened?</p>
<p>There&amp;#x27;s a Season 3 potential spoiler, but why is that? That&amp;#x27;s a question House of Cards fans are asking, so it&amp;#x27;s cool to have it answered. I can&amp;#x27;t see that happening.</p>
<p>And, of course. There&amp;#x27;s talk from season 3, at least, that this won&amp;#x27;t end. It already was sort of in the set up of Season 2: It started a lot late, but it moved up significantly. I definitely don&amp;#x27;t want that. At the very least the series will have the ending, and I think the last episode is pretty anticlimactic.</p>
<p>TVGoblin and I talked about one of my favorite House of Cards episodes--another one that was really special to me. The house stuff with Liam, going back and forth like nothing happened. The process...to me, it was no big deal. As is usual with these, it added to the excitement and it just made me want to keep watching with high expectations...and they did it in three really compelling episodes. And again, a lot of it was the ending of season 2. There was no other show I could compare this Season 3 to in how good it was. I feel like there wasn&amp;#x27;t.</p>
