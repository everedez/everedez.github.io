Prologue<br>

Sora<br>
</p>
<p>The first meeting between this series of chapters is taking place at Sorai. This is Japan&amp;#x27;s oldest inhabited island (and oldest city) and the only island in the Kanto region connected to Shinju Bay, with the Sorai Peninsula being an island in the sea close to the Bay&amp;#x27;s western shore. This is a port town, surrounded by and connected to town but separate from this town. In the real-life Battle of Sanjuro, at the northern end of the island, Sorai was the headquarters of Okabe&amp;#x27;s forces. In the show, the island the &amp;quot;Showa Dam&amp;quot; was stationed near Sorai&amp;#x27;s western shore, just east from the Port of Narushima.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Most of Sorai, the island, is a peninsula. The coastlines to the west of the peninsula are considered to be the northern coast, and, as seen in the anime, the coastlines to the east of the peninsula are considered to be the southern coast. The northern shore is closer to the seas; while it is also close to the western shore of the Bay, the southern shore of the island is much more western. Although they are not connected to the ocean, the western shore has a high land area, and features the &amp;quot;Showa Dam.&amp;quot; Also, the western shore&amp;#x27;s coastline is quite narrow. The distance between the western coast and the ocean is only about 110 min.</p>
<p>Dori Island in the ocean to the south of Sorai is also connected to Sorai and Narushima.</p>
