<h1>Corey Spann Nj</h1>
<p>Many talented candidates and deserving individuals are vying for the top spot in this race. Some consider that to be a lack of “luck” or lack of “ingratiating” and have started to ask if “success” has to be a “desire,” or if anyone really achieves anything unless they “go for it.” But, do they really “get it,” or does that not accurately reflect what they thought that they had? Does success truly mean that someone “earns” something, or is that just a sales pitch?</p>
<p>
I have always believed there has to be a specific pathway for someone to achieve success.<br>
This isn’t to say that the winner has all of the answers to be considered the champion of the industry!<br>
After all, who exactly “earns” whatever that their “one” goal is?<br>
</p>
<p>I challenge us to look at what is “common practice” in the industry. We must first examine our ideas about success. Does this make sense, or does it not? We can spend a lot of time and energy but do we actually achieve anything?</p>
<p>While I believe we do create something out of nothing, this doesn’t mean anything to an audience who does not have a common common sense about what to observe, or even if a particular problem is something worth considering.</p>
<p>Here are the criteria that I use as a critical instrument in assessing if someone really does achieve something, or if it doesn’t really matter:</p>
<p>Was the “realization” of the solution by the team they mentored, applied learning or experience to production and sold to the customer.</p>
<p>
Were they recognized or even thanked for their efforts and contributions?<br>
Were they willing to admit to whatever they had done?<br>
Were they willing to accept critiques or the feedback of others or their own?<br>
Had the “goal” they set seemed realistic?<br>
Have they produced results beyond what they had originally planned?<br>
</p>
