<h1>Let Us Talents And Tongues Employ</h1>
<p>Welcome back to my journal and here are my top 3 talents and 2 tongues that you’ll want on your tombstone for reasons already mentioned. I won’t include any names in the title of the article like the Taoist Hui Dao, which if not for being dead, would be the supreme winner at the 17th Tournament of Alchemy and Poetry of the third century. But my friend, The Chaldean Prog, does not require naming in his case except for the title “prog”. An apt title in my opinion. They are all that is left after I failed miserably at my qualification exams of the Black Moon Order. Too bad, but that was my fault. So I always think about what I might have done better. Though now that I think about it, and I do, I wish I had done better, because I also failed at the last 2 examinations to get my jade of 3 kinds. A complete failure.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exam paper any more, you see. This isn’t because the Black Moon Order has ended. Though that may well be the case, I have no interest in talking about such details on this website, be it here or on a forum. I have no interest in either talking about exams or giving out solutions about my “classes”. I have an interest in just making people, including my friends, think and I’m sure a lot of you do in your own way. I cannot stand exams on Earth or the Moon, even though they are among life. The Moon is where the game continues, as this is it. Without the Moon, the game would be nothing. Sometimes I have my reasons for not playing the game on Earth or the Moon. Oh yes, I am proud to have signed a contract with the Black Moon Order. Although that doesn’t stop me from deciding on different rules. I will never cease to be philosophical. Never. I believe in that philosophy; perhaps more than my other philosophies. My philosophy is called “The Order of the Black Moon“. Sometimes I joke and call it the Order of the Boox, as there are no proper booxes on the Moon, and some times I refer to it as their title. In any case I did something in my previous life that gave me this name.</p>
