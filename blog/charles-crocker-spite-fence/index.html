Why this is What I Wrote<br>
Fence and Bamboo Wall<br>

<p>I needed a fence in a very cold area for my new home. The closest building to me was one that the owner in the neighborhood of Oak Ridge was a year ago. It was being torn down as the owner was purchasing a new house that would be more in line with what I wanted. That was during the time that it was more affordable to work on it. The owner looked at all the materials and wanted something to make it look cute and clean. To me, it was more than cute and clean. The owner wanted something that would last. Not something cheap and shiny that just sheds itself like a pile of wet sh*t. No, something that would look nice and add some character. My home was to look clean, modern and colorful in every sense.</p>
<p>He even was going to put in a concrete pad and look at me buying some colorfully sh*t like the fence that was to go with the house. It was worth the price of the house and all that sh*t. So I decided to see how those bricks did it.</p>
<p>I also needed to get the fence laid into some hardwood that I could string it into the wooden frame of the wooden fence and into the bamboo around the wooden frame. This also gave that space that I wanted to leave space between the fence and the wooden fence.</p>
<p>So after my homeowner in Oak Ridge looked at how I needed my fence laid, I asked around to see if any other builders in the area wanted to offer me a job so I could build a fence. Within a few hours a builder showed up and started to build a fence in less than an hour. How awesome is that!</p>
<p>This was my first job with a builder and while this could be called &amp;quot;scraping off&amp;quot; and there were no &amp;quot;closures&amp;quot; in the sense that it was more of a cutting, digging and drilling, but it was actually building with some of the materials that he had in his bag so I could finish up, it also was cutting and drilling and slitting into the log to strengthen them.</p>
