<h1>Kapital Virgin Mary Fleece</h1>
<p>The new Kapital design for Kapital in Miami&amp;#x27;s Design District is one of the most exciting new fashions of 2017.The newest Kapital pieces are eco-friendly, sleek, and have a fabulous flow that suits to the style of its clients. The result is a streamlined look, but it still has a feminine touch so that the pieces will fit nicely into both business and home too. The Kapital collection from Verona is their first to appeal to consumers of any age.</p>
<p>The new collection in Miami is definitely a shift in the streetwear and fashion scene. Kapital and Verona are the two most well known brands in Miami. Fleece is a great new choice for a new era of streetwear. One of the key features that distinguish this brand from many other mainstream brands in the same industry is how the fabric is made. The fabrics used for Kapital’s clothing and accessories are not polyester, they are pure nylon. This means that they offer maximum protection against any sort of abuse to the fabric.</p>
<p>The Verona range also offers soft fabrics that are very easy to care for. Their pieces are available in both cotton and cashmere so that it appeals to both men and women. They are also known for their high quality fabrics.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Working with Verona on all elements of the design process was a major pleasure. We worked with the two of them at the beginning of the process to design two layers of Kapital materials: Fleece, which is heavy and warm, and textiles that are soft and light, the same way as everything we do.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>For her new line, Sophia Angelone, founded in New York, New York, The Voice of Liberty, a line of innovative, high-quality, high-fashion women&amp;#x27;s streetwear, selected Kapital as the new fabric manufacturer to use to create her brand. A renowned streetwear designer in her field, Sophia is no stranger to the Miami Design District. For example, she worked in the area when she started her designing career, and was featured prominently in the designer Shaker Alley’s runway show while she was there. He also noticed her quick work and noted her amazing photography skills. After collaborating with K&amp;amp;Co who created the brand, Sophia had left the market and worked with her then boyfriend, Arcee Fox, a clothing designer.</p>
