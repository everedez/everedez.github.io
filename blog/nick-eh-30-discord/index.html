<h2>Taufik 18 30 Discord</h2>
<p>For the next five days, we’re posting photos of the top piracy vectors (other than the infamous Pirate Bay) here at CCROVE.com. These are drawn by CCROVE’s photographer and Creative Director Tom Kurton, and we’re posting them for the very rare opportunity to see pirates as they actually exist, not be influenced by media memes.</p>
<p>If you want to see real piracy you’d find only in the movies and shows, you’ll need to see Tom’s work. Want to see real piracy then try these first. (Don’t forget to click “Show more” on the images!):</p>
<p>
Terrified of getting lost in a crowd, so a surfer steals his ticket<br>
Terrified of something frightening, an American becomes a gangster when he finds himself in the movies<br>
A free online video poker tournament only used once a year takes $40,000 in cash<br>
The first internet video streaming service becomes hit after pirates<br>
A sad film captures the sting of a U.S. police and FBI sting<br>
A new, high-speed, voice-activated, internet telephone<br>
Video pirates and their victims get along when they’re robbed of privacy (like old cars)<br>
An internet radio that ends up being illegal (like satellite radio)<br>
A film on a cat-and-mouse story that gets played in bars and is given away for free<br>
</p>
<p>A film that looks like it’s ‘for the kids’ but could conceivably be taken seriously if the filmmakers actually thought it through. You know, actually shown as an educational film for kids?</p>
