<h1>Pine Tree Shilling Value</h1>
<p>In a survey conducted May 1-29, 2013, Ipsos/PSH conducts opinion surveys to understand how people in Australia view political topics and the politician who brings them into public view. This is our perspective from the Ipsos poll.</p>
<p>
Who would you rather have as prime minister if Australian politics were still the old school monarchy?<br>
Number 1. Steve while he is young.<br>
Number 2. Gillard<br>
Number 3. Tony Abbott<br>
</p>
<p>Number 4. Gillard (Reposted at 7/1/2013: 6:39 a.m. EST; a reposted Ipsos/PSH poll for The Australian; a reposted J.D. Molloy article on the Prime Minister&amp;#x27;s race towards election)</p>
<p>
Tony Abbott<br>
12.6%<br>
Steve Abbott<br>
12.2%<br>
J.D. Molloy<br>
2.3%<br>
Norman Project<br>
Ipsos<br>
</p>
<p>General election, Julia Gillard vs Tony Abbott; Results: the PM is the least popular prime minister Australia ever had (of the one candidate that came forward) with a winning margin of just 0.5% over ALP. The public are much more positive about Abbott than Gillard and so does Tony Abbott</p>
<p>*We&amp;#x27;re sorry, but we currently do not have access to the survey, either as you may be unable access our web site, please register to upgrade. You can try later, if you wish, at &amp;quot;admin.org/register&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>The lack of the Australian public backing for Julia Gillard to continue with her premiership in the absence of a viable internal candidate could well lead to her own leadership contest. With the strongest preference for Ms Abbott in the last poll, she&amp;#x27;s got some serious issues to live up to in her own performance in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Julia Gillard is sitting for her premiership at the next federal election. Polls come down.</p>
<p>The poll indicates that after years of consistent popularity, Ms Gillard is struggling and that her public standing is dwindling. She is looking really, really tired.</p>
<p>To repeat, but this time with some emphasis added, having a sitting prime minister in a coalition is the most untouchable, unenviable job in politics. Especially a one-term prime minister.</p>
