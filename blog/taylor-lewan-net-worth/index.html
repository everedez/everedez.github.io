<p>Early Life &amp;amp; Early Career – Amy Winehouse is an English singer and songwriter, best known for writing The Glasshouse, one of the best songs about relationships in music. She released the album Amy Winehouse in 2003. She married ex-porn star Karl Hall in the mid-1990s. Amy grew up in Harlow, Essex. When her father was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, she moved back to London with her mother and brother. When her mother left the family home, Amy agreed to stay behind and care for her father. She also encouraged her to become a writer, as she used to write songs for her when she was a child. This was very dangerous as she had once been taken in by a lonely, angry, abused girl and slept with a boy she never saw. Amy turned to songwriting when she was troubled at being on the mean streets of London and asked a friend to help her find self-esteem. Her writing career has been dominated by her work with many artists who include Amy Winehouse and her friend Rufus Wainwright on the 1998 album, Amy Winehouse. She also wrote and sang for Amy&amp;#x27;s brother as a child. She had various musical projects throughout the years with her sister Rosie before she was signed to a record label when she was 21. In early 2004, Amy went to India to do a series of television shows with her friend Sam Uppy. Sam moved to London to do the musical projects of his friend and musician, Amy Winehouse. They became close friends and have even published a friendship song (which unfortunately was never performed). Sam said in an interview to Metro that Amy had become like a &amp;quot;part of his family&amp;quot; on his shows. In 2005 he left Amy in London because she was unhappy working with some people and so he did his own live shows. Sam moved back to Essex but Amy still lived in London when Sam moved to Essex. Amy travelled to various countries throughout the years and sometimes stayed in the same house when on holiday. It is not clear what changes her life became when this occurred. Sam did a session with Amy.</p>
