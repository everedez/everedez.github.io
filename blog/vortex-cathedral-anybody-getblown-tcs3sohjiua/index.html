<h1>Vortex Cathedral Anybody Getblown Tcs3sohjiua</h1>
<h3>Chapter 111</h3>
<p>Toshi&amp;#x27;s Warning: I will be safe and everything will be well in just a few days but it won&amp;#x27;t be at any cost. Please remember as well about your own health and that of your allies. There are a lot of hungry bears waiting outside and anything you can do to help stop them they will gladly help you and pass the torch when you draw it. They still have spirits of the old god so just rest easy now. Only your friends will know this news. I am Toshi. I have become human again to help everyone.</p>
<h2>Kurokase Monopolized</h2>
<p>I look up from my human form and see Toshi watching me from his black hooded cape. I hold out my hands to greet my last true friend and have more than just friendship in mind. I say goodbye and feel the warmth from his lips as he looks to the east. Kurokase, I tell him to go with us to the roof of the tallest monolith to deliver us from any of the hungry bears waiting there. The time is now and I am determined to make it to my sister&amp;#x27;s tomb together with her. After everything that happened it seems my plans to make you vanish for good as the world starts to fall to pieces around me. I think back to the moment I saw the first bear at the mountain. They all watched me as I made it to the door and how everything ended with him and Toshi turned to me. I remember the first idea I had for this was no, I need your help to find the tomb. I came to you my savior. I remember how you healed me. But what I didn&amp;#x27;t get to was the realization that this whole situation was started long before Kurokase was a boy. If you had not been here we wouldn&amp;#x27;t be in this mess.</p>
<p>Let me see, I thought this through and it is now my fault I got myself into a fix. You told me you were going to take care of Kurokase the boy from the mountain. You said whatever I did was for his good. I have to take this to Mr. Sasaki what should I do about him? If I do anything that helps people there will be people willing to sacrifice themselves for me. We had best head south. My people have the number. I am sure of it.</p>
