In Celestial Steeds we are always interested in how heroes could combine with birds and beasts to survive.

<h1>Celestial Steed Sails</h1>

<p>In Celestial Steeds we are always interested in how heroes could combine with birds and beasts to survive. So we&amp;#x27;ve put together a 3D model of a couple of them and made it into a Sailing Game based on the Fantasy Almanac for August. This is going to be easy to get your hands on and your friends should be glad that they can pick up some Celestial Steeds that weren&amp;#x27;t crafted in an age past. We hope you like it!</p>

The Celestial Steeds - Steed Types<br>
The Celestial Steeds are the 3 steed types in the Stellaris universe, described in the following three color<br>
options: Green - Noble Steeds of Justice<br>
Ruby - Divine Celestial Steeds of Strife<br>
Orange - Divine Celestial Steeds of Fury<br>
</p>
<p>The Steed Types represent different type of Beast with different weaknesses and strengths - to enhance them even more we decided to come up with 3 kinds of Celestial Steeds based on different beasts and their 3 weaknesses:</p>
<p>The Noble Steeds - Noble Celestial Steeds of Justice</p>
<p>Vampires are the best form of Steed to use against the Darklings or any enemy with superior support such as Ravagers or Golems.The Celestial Steeds of this kind seem to excel in the normal modes, but the 2nd round or all the way through it still remains a challenge. A Celestial Steed with a good Sire is the best in this sort of scenario.It can also be a perfect form of support for Witch Steeds if you are using a Sire and a Celestial with equal Support. It&amp;#x27;s good for building your Sire&amp;#x27;s attacks or Specialists abilities - but it&amp;#x27;s a bit poor in special skills such as the Water of Life.</p>
<p>The Divine Celestial Steeds - Divine Celestial Steeds of Strife</p>
<p>Mightiest of all Celestial Steeds, because they are blessed with the might of God himself. The heavenly guards of the Celestian Steeds are not only on the frontlines, but also walk the battlefield with their cross swords and shield against all invaders. The Celestial Steeds of this type go in for their particular specialty - the Slaying strike - all by sheer power of the Divine nature. The Celestial Steeds of this type possess a unique Specialty - the Endless Strike.</p>
