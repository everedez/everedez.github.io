This is a new development that I don&amp;#x27;t understand. Any replies?<br>
</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Bitcoin Core devs are in a hurry to dump all the coin on to network swaps. Except for that small group of users still holding their coins on exchanges, I see no potential for them to eventually make it work.</p>
<p>And yes, you still have 2 to keep buying and selling whatever it is you want, right?</p>
