<p>In full... Karen, you have to choose to be a great mother and take time out for your loved ones, you are a strong woman that does it all. I know I can’t always do it for you all the time so I’ll be there for you all the time.</p>
<p>I know it sounds pretty selfish that you would take a few minutes out of your day and do something like this, but my point is “when you love someone, it’s not selfish.” You asked for my support and I’ve been giving it freely since you made this post. I’m only being mean by saying we are each other’s best support system and the best part of me is that I can’t rely on anyone but you. And I know this isn’t getting to much because there hasn’t been a lot of stuff coming out of your mouth lately but Karen, you just want to be your beautiful, selfless and strong self. I know you’re tired of this but I love you and I hope that you know it’s not just me, I love you and it’s not about me. Even if our relationship is going in a new direction, it’s not just about me. I am so worried for you and I do appreciate a support I’ve never had.</p>
<p>For me, I am going to be there for you in ANY and ALL your moments when you need it. And I believe you know this as I’ve seen this post multiple times over the past week.</p>
