No need to design the fence for fences.
This expandable fence actually helps to take the burden of the fence designs.
There&amp;#x27;s lot of people trying to create their own tree fence and also want to put it as the borders of the gardens or as an ornamental stone.
We strongly urge to to use this tree fence as the border of our gardens and also want to make it an ornamental part of it.">

<h1>Expandable Fence With Leaves</h1>
<p>
By Checosaurus<br>
No need to design the fence for fences.<br>
This expandable fence actually helps to take the burden of the fence designs.<br>
</p>
<p>There&amp;#x27;s lot of people trying to create their own tree fence and also want to put it as the borders of the gardens or as an ornamental stone.</p>
<p>We strongly urge to to use this tree fence as the border of our gardens and also want to make it an ornamental part of it.</p>
<p>How to make it possible?</p>
<p>- Make use of the proper tools:</p>
<p>- Some of the basic tools:</p>
<p>1. Angle wrench:</p>
<p>- Drill the hole where the screw has been fixed to the nut and check whether it is in line.</p>
<p>2. Cutting wheels:</p>
<p>- The flat on the tires are the ones you should use to get the widest border. (I don&amp;#x27;t know why but the wheels need to be cut to the same size. If they aren&amp;#x27;t the same size, the base will be less and easily to bend on the tires.)</p>
<p>3. Kofler bit:</p>
<p>
- For getting the right clearance all over the frame.<br>
4. Screw driver<br>
- Racks are available from the market. You can also get online.<br>
7. Hexagon cutter<br>
- For getting a line in a straight line from the side.<br>
8. Tool for taking off the edge of the joint.<br>
- Make use of it to cut off the part of the frame that is held by the nuts.<br>
9. Proving the clearance<br>
- The lower joint of the frame needs to be less than the size of the nut (minus half of the thick frame).<br>
- Get the clearance by using Proving tools.<br>
</p>
<p>10. The correct spacing between the posts is important. Find it.</p>
<p>
- It&amp;#x27;s not so difficult, just give it a break and be patient.<br>
11. Adjust the top &amp;amp; bottom<br>
- Adjust the top and bottom to get a proper height.<br>
- Make some braces to hold the whole frame at a certain height.<br>
12. Getting the right clearance at the bottom.<br>
</p>
