<p>There is always one moment when the ordinary stops to make a supremely high claim upon yourself, when something so true and important that it would not lie hidden for ever within you. And you find yourself entirely overwhelmed by its vastness and yet... and... You think to yourself, &amp;quot;how can anyone feel like I can stand this?&amp;quot;</p>
<p>
And there is a moment...<br>
What?<br>
(...I see him.)<br>
</p>
<p>(Who? Well, there was a...there was a woman with the Moleskine or something... and a man who was in the throes of something of an orgasm... I&amp;#x27;m not sure if that&amp;#x27;s right, it was just an impression. But she&amp;#x27;s got this really lovely smile that she has. And she was definitely pointing to a book. And... He&amp;#x27;s carrying a big leather and metal bag. And the man is with her. And... she&amp;#x27;s talking as he goes, and I think I thought: &amp;quot;thank you to any God you wish, any luck you might pray for, any favor you might request... and I&amp;#x27;m out of sight). And the... the two have entered some little room, you know... there&amp;#x27;s the moment that there is some light and then there is no light. As though the room were transformed. But if you were to describe it, there was no right or wrong place in there but the inside of the room felt like everywhere was the inside of nowhere at the same time. And... and the woman was saying something to the man and the man saying something back.</p>
