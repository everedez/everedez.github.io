<h1>Tyler Doyle On Bail</h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>When Bail was released, I instantly jumped to comment on it as being too much of a terrible idea. I had been campaigning for a while to see whether I should get behind the idea and continue to harass Nintendo, before ultimately deciding that I would be all for it.</p>
<p>Only one Twitter user who did not chime in. He tweeted me saying something along the lines of: If I didn’t like Bail, I would never see another game, that’s it!</p>
<p>I was then shocked to read the link to the Bail-less link set-up as well, seeing as most articles are full of it being so bad that if they want to dismiss the announcement, I will be so very glad they did so.</p>
<p>The website of the Playstation 3 has also been updated to make it clear that the system is a supporter of Bail’s idea, and the reason the internet has been buzzing on this, is because Sony have shown their support by running a fun Bail Challenge.</p>
<h2>Controversy</h2>
<p>Sitting down to watch the interview that gave me so much faith in the system, I noticed my trust in Bail was completely broken and that I may have just got in over my head.</p>
<p>In the interview, I was referred to as being the ‘hundreds of thousands of YouTube viewers’ for being the president for ‘no-nonsense’ gamers, much like it was the case when Koss posted on their Facebook status that they were all about being kind to gamers.</p>
<p>Did I watch it? I was at work at the time, even though I had no idea that a video linked to this had been up for a year of showing how gamers were being treated by big companies. Plus, the interviews tend to be taken down after a while, so it was bound to pop up later.</p>
<p>For all of you that think that simply going to a few websites, the website of your Playstation 3, and having your fan site take down the story is all you need, to me, it looks like we have a serious problem in this world of ours.</p>
<p>I can understand if you don’t like this announcement of the whole thing, but then after it was linked on the most popular news website on the planet, I then see the gaming world frowning at this news.</p>
