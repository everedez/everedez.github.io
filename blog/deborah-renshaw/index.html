<h1>Deborah Renshaw</h1>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Staged reading and other performances</p>
<p>Deborah Renshaw began acting at the age of 8 in a school play. She read The Old Vic at the age of 13, and in her early teenage years she took acting classes but never had the talent to do her first TV or film roles. Until her early twenties, she tried several jobs and eventually fulfilled the role of &amp;#x27;Cathy Hymowitz&amp;#x27; in Simon Messinger&amp;#x27;s soap opera &amp;#x27;Skins&amp;#x27;, after the actor who played that role disappeared. To add to her acting experience, Deborah was a part of the production team for local charity, Comic Relief, in which she was also involved in designing the posters and magazine advertising the event. She also worked part time as a bank teller or at parties, but always had time to play – and work – in theatre.</p>
<p>Deborah read for an exam, obtaining a first for drama, and then wanted to apply to Cambridge University to write her B.A. in Philosophy and Politics, but her father put her off as he felt it was important that Debbie didn&amp;#x27;t drop out of college without an offer.</p>
<p>Deborah Renshaw graduated with a B.A. in Philosophy and Politics from Cambridge University with first class honours in March 2003.</p>
<p>Deborah has done works at the Peacock Playhouse, many of which are in the current repertoire. She currently appears in the regional theatres, Theatre Royal, Brighton and the Vauxhall Theatre, Cambridge, as well as touring extensively.</p>
<p>Deborah played a role in the New Statesman&amp;#x27;s review of recent US Presidential debates. She read for a paper for another review of that debate written by Alice Waters and Susan Wolfe (The Wall Street Journal). Deborah was invited to write about and review the performance. She gave all three of her papers, and the paper that she read had a major effect on the paper she had to write after that.</p>
<p>Deborah is represented by the Michael Rosen Company, a team of professionals with whom she has collaborated professionally in the theatre for over 20 years.</p>
