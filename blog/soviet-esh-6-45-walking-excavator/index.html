<h1>Soviet Эш 6/45 Walking Excavator</h1>
<p>(Russian design by the Russian Association of Civil Construction and Military Works. Design not a product of any company. Its model is based on a mobile construction crane produced by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the 1980s. The model is based on a mobile construction crane by the Russian Ministry of Defense in the 1980s.)</p>
<p>The Walking Excavator is similar to the Russian army excavator, which is for big heavy buildings and structures, while the Walking Excavator is particularly well-suited for big outdoor building projects. It is not designed for all buildings: for ordinary buildings with lightweight structures, the excavator may be a suitable choice. (Walking Excavator is actually the name of a mason&amp;#x27;s work...)</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The Walking Excavator is built from heavy steel and cement concrete. The wheels are not designed to run over rough ground</p>
<p>Each of the three wheels is a casting formed from three segments welded to form a wheel, secured to one end of the wheel base and a pulley attaching the two ends of the wheel to the wheel base... (...)The design is based on the design of the Russian army excavator, which is for big buildings and structures. The wheels are not designed to run over rough ground. Their wheel base can carry not more than 180 t of general compressive load. Each wheel provides not more than 300 t work load. The wheel base can carry not more than 20 t work load (kwh). The number of &amp;quot;soft compressive&amp;quot; load-carrying members is three. (...)</p>
<p>The largest wheel is 31.6 m in diameter and has an iron castwheel rim of 5.2 m diameter, used in the K-25 wheel castings with high alloy steel sheet. It covers 30.9 m area. The wheel can be used in a for not more than 10 t work load (kwh). With its 5.8 m diameter casting wheels made of high alloy steel, on the project&amp;#x27;s central drum 2 units, wheel casting of 3.36 m diameter, covering 3.9 m area, 2 units provide 10 t work load.</p>
<p>The smallest wheel can be made from 16.3 m wheel casting, made of 18.75 mm stainless steel bars, producing an area of 48.19 m2. With its 20.54 m2 wheel casting, it can provide 4.</p>
