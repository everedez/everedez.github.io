<h1>Mac Hot And Bothered Lipstick</h1>
<p>I haven&amp;#x27;t made a deep dive into the beauty product of the year so far for my Beauty Goddess of 2011, but I want to try out the three lipsticks and another lipstick for the year - I want to get better at checking out and testing new products. I have already become quite familiar with and invested more in the three amazing lipsticks, so I&amp;#x27;m okay with that.</p>
<p>I ordered a few as a sample and I saw two in the mail already - which makes me glad that I waited this long. And the girls sent me a bag of other goodies in a pretty gift set. And they&amp;#x27;ve really worked their charms on me - I&amp;#x27;m amazed and very appreciative of all the good things that they&amp;#x27;ve done for me. My makeup and hair have no needs to be altered drastically; I&amp;#x27;ve already tried out all the lip sticks.</p>
<p>(But yes, they&amp;#x27;re crazy gorgeous.)</p>
<p>I finally got to try out the three amazing lipsticks and I&amp;#x27;m particularly excited to try these two - both from Bourjoire. First up, Butter Creme Lipgloss. This is a pink color that feels warm and natural - without being oily, although you would probably want to tone it a little in the summer months for a summertime look.</p>
<p>Not a lipshadow on the Rich! Real Lipstick palette! Not something I would go insane over.</p>
<p>(butter cream is such a pussified color!)</p>
<p>First up, just like the polka dot in the Rich! Real Beauty Lipgloss palette, the Butter Cream Lipgloss gives way to this matte pink. And it turns red on my lips when I apply it. It&amp;#x27;s incredibly soft.</p>
<p>This lipstick is not super creamy at all - this could be a bottle which you wouldn&amp;#x27;t be able to wear if you&amp;#x27;ve never applied lipstick. However, this is actually a very light matte tone and it&amp;#x27;s actually a very creamy, smooth formula. All of this comes from the fine and fine texture of the butter cream and then the liquid inside. It doesn&amp;#x27;t tend to melt and stick to your lips but it actually glides on - this is very nice texture.</p>
<p>The packaging is gorgeous on the Rich! Real Lipstick, too. You&amp;#x27;ll definitely want to be careful and touch up your lipstick for this.</p>
