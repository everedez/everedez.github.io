My goal is simple
I must be the first person to achieve a 60fps over 6 months.
If i succeed, this must be recognized.
At least I&amp;#x27;m not the only one.
I&amp;#x27;ll keep this note here as the main source of motivation.
The second goal is to get out of the cage as fast as possible.
There are a million ways to achieve a 60fps, and there has to be a way that">

There are a million ways to achieve a 60fps, and there has to be a way that<br>
doesn&amp;#x27;t require you to leave the game.<br>
I found a system that seems to be pretty good.<br>
However, I decided to do it through cheat codes<br>
which are explained right here in a<br>
sample. However, I&amp;#x27;m not really in this life<br>
if you need to rewrite things in a cheat, you may<br>
expect a certain amount of difficulty.<br>
However, it hasn&amp;#x27;t to be.<br>
So, I&amp;#x27;d like to see you more involved as I&amp;#x27;m sure you find it a lot easier than everything I&amp;#x27;ve been told.<br>
</p>
<p>This might just be the beginning and nothing I can do by myself at all, rather I wanna be the first person to achieve a 60fps over 6 months.</p>
<p>Now I must wait for my roommate to get his machine.</p>
<p>If you want to help, I&amp;#x27;m sure you will be happy to take a look at this system while I&amp;#x27;m in a cage, but it has to be a fair system.</p>
<p>
In my game i&amp;#x27;ll show you how I found this.<br>
At a speed where it doesn&amp;#x27;t even look like i have any lag, and at a framerate of 50fps I get<br>
60fps over the day.<br>
Obviously, I did this using cheat codes because I wanted to be absolutely certain that<br>
this was something I knew off hand after a few readings.<br>
I simply assumed I&amp;#x27;d know which cheat to use that would give me a fairer result, in a way that was fair.<br>
