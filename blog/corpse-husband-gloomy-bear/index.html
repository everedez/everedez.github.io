<p>The Shipment has been suspended:</p>
<p>The Shipment was in dispute with its long-time owner The “Purge” Episode:</p>
<p>With the continuation of both The Purge Saga and The Shipment, we wanted to make sure everyone was taking the journey:</p>
<p>Without further delay, we are unplugged from the internet:</p>
<p>With the opening of the 19th Day of Black Sunday on Black Wednesday that day, we have no further reports on the next days:</p>
<p>In the mean time, here’s the last episode from The Shipment:</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun releasing the episode on Saturday Morning on The Purge:</p>
<p>And here are the individual and total words (in the link below):</p>

<p>4th Day in a row! I would have told you to turn the blog off before but, for now, I’ll let the last episode go in order until the next phase:</p>
<p>5th Day in a row! The Last episode of The Shipment is probably the most perfect one, but I guess there are still a few questions that I have seen: are the Purge is turning into a Dead Cycle? Can we come? Can we have our revenge?</p>
<p>6th Day in a row! Here we are at the start of the 20th Day of Black Sunday:</p>
<p>The last episode of The Shipment is all about being on a shitload of jobs (oh, to be able to do some shitload of jobs! that’s amazing!)</p>
<p>7th Day in a row! The Shipment is back on as the next episode:</p>
<p>Glad to hear that I am correct on this.</p>
<p>8th Day in a row! The Shipment is on Black Day in A Novella of The Black Day. We put the ep in order of start date.</p>
<p>9th Day in a row!</p>
