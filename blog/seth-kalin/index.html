<h1>Seth Kalin</h1>
<h3>Profile:</h3>
<p>Seth Kalin was the creator and head game journalist of The Tech, an online community devoted to covering software development news. After 15 years at IGN, Kalin began freelancing full-time. His first book, Pixels, cover stories, game videos, book projects, and freelance reporting on the movies and television industry are all attributed to his prolific input and editorial creativity. For the last decade he has specialized in video games at video-game news sites including Electronic Gaming Monthly, Polygon, IGN, and Giant Bomb. He also has worked at VDARE.com and GamePro.</p>
<h2>Resume:</h2>
<p>Seth Kalin has over 20 years of experience as a game developer and video producer.</p>
<p>He has worked with Microsoft, Square Enix, Activision, and Ubisoft, all within the last decade.</p>
<p>Kalin was once Executive Editor of IGN’s Games, Movies and TV where he became Chief Gaming Critic and did a fine job of leading the site in its first dozen years.</p>
<p>Kalin&amp;#x27;s early work at IGN has won awards and he&amp;#x27;s the author of several books. He is a self-proclaimed nerd and loves writing about geek culture.</p>
<p>He also played professional gamer at one point and holds a BS in science &amp;amp; engineering (ag.) from the University of Colorado in Boulder, which helped him understand how good games actually work. After graduating, he joined Konami as an engineer and was lead in development of the Crash Team Racing series.</p>
<p>He has been happily freelancing ever since, mainly providing reviews and editorials at GamePro, EGM.com, Eurogamer.com, and Giant Bomb. Kalin also works with games.com. His freelancing exploits are covered in a recent column in the webzine, Webgamer.</p>
<p>While freelancer/reviewer/GEEKER, he’s also organized more than 1000 happy gamers/games. For the past few years, he’s lived in Europe in order to work a full-time job and continued to play and to write about games as far away as Asia.</p>
<p>He’s the author of two books/works: Pixels, the seminal publication of the game-playing world and responsible for its coverage, and The Geek Kids - How to Take Your Game to the Next Level.</p>
