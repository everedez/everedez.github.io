<h1>Brandon Budd Monster Truck</h1>
<h3>The AutoAnything Dealership and the Hardware Store</h3>
<p>You can get almost everything with a little digging and a few finds at AutoAnything - while the hardware store does have it&amp;#x27;s usual excellent selection of tools and hardware, AutoAnything&amp;#x27;s top priority is on the “tools your people really need” of tools and parts.</p>
<p>This list includes everything that we could find, but also includes things like parts that we really wouldn&amp;#x27;t buy (like pneumatic tools and flatbed trailers). Even though we’re now on the phone the “auto” and “mobile” channels, we still recommend that you become an AutoAnything dealer yourself and they can give you a good head start on finding all of their most wanted stuff.</p>
<p>So there are a few things here:</p>
<p>Headphones: Low-profile and low-profile pairs are all the rage these days. We got this one for more than $50 from a site called Active Headphones, and these come in five colors. The difference is minimal, but the drivers for these earphones include comfort, noise reduction, and performance.</p>
<p>Drink H2O: Again, a key feature of this brand is the “5-year warranty on parts, as well as any leaky, burst-prone coolants you might find all over these trucks.</p>
<p>Do you need: A heavy-duty starter? We also like the company&amp;#x27;s own series of 20-panel starter packs.</p>
<p>Haggenhuset: We wanted to mention this line of vehicles because much of what they do is very similar, and the parts lines are well-integrated. The parts are made from durable materials and do a good job of holding the noise isolating parts in place better than any equivalent brand. The options include a 3-speed gearbox and 10.5-inch-wheelbase semi-trailer truck conversion kit. You can check out their website to see options, and the cars they&amp;#x27;re customizing.</p>
<p>Wheels/Trailers: While there isn&amp;#x27;t much about the truck itself that we like (or don&amp;#x27;t), we&amp;#x27;d like to mention that we&amp;#x27;ve had a few trucks over the years that come with a larger and longer wheelbase than might be on other vehicles.</p>
