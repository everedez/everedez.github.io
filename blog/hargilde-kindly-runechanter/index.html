<h1>Hargilde Kindly Runechanter</h1>
<p>*NOTE: The following is a minor bug; please work in cooperation with your team and take advantage of the buff in order to obtain the necessary buffs in Time Warp.</p>
<p>While the hero&amp;#x27;s Ultimate skill in Time Warp is unlocked on the forums, your individual time zone cannot be mapped by time. Time warp is not affected by time zones.</p>
<h2>Attacker or Assailant</h2>
<p>While the heroes should be unable to use all of their cooldowns while traveling in a time warp, they should be able to perform secondary tasks because of the buffs in Time Warp. Note however, that the level of the abilities required for secondary tasks will decrease on time warp.</p>
<h2>Level 10: Criegling Runechanter</h2>
<h3>Target: Attackers or Assailants</h3>
<p>Am I confused? It is very possible to simply map your opponent to Time Warp twice in a row, making the heroes unable to cast their cooldowns, gaining an increased damage output each time. If the buffs are too strong for this, simply click the Time Warp button for the buff in time warp twice in a row.</p>
<h2>Level 20: Criegling Runechanter</h2>
<h3>Target: Attackers or Assailants</h3>
<p>May I ask what effect this buff will have if applied before the level 20 hero has gained control over their action point locations? Perhaps this will simply make them unable to cast their cooldowns, but at least for this hero and/or time zone, they will be able to cast their cooldowns at higher levels?</p>
<h2>Criegling Runechanter Level 20: Mobs</h2>
<h3>Fated Assailant</h3>
<p>When you&amp;#x27;re fighting Mobs, the buff in Time Warp is sometimes just a waste of time. For those of you who are unable to cast the cooldowns used to control over action point locations, this buff in Time Warp will only be effective for those heroes who have already been &amp;#x27;assailed&amp;#x27; for the duration of the buff.</p>
<h2>Target: Mobs</h2>
<p>May I suggest that you begin your Time Warp with 1 hero: The Fated Assailant.</p>
