Another quick comment<br>
</p>
<p>I wish there was a way to pay my miner by BTC after going to the p2p platform. Sure, no major problems if that&amp;#x27;s what you want.</p>
<p>If my interest is purely p2p as these things are known, then that&amp;#x27;s ok, I probably wouldn&amp;#x27;t use it unless I knew I could at least compensate a miner so they&amp;#x27;d pay in BTC (I already have a mining contract with them), but I actually wouldn&amp;#x27;t really need that function as I already had Bitminer, and that&amp;#x27;s where the money comes from.</p>
