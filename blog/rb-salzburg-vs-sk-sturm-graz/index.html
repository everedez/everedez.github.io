<h1>Rb Salzburg Vs Sk Sturm Graz</h1>
<p>Rb Salzburg vs Sk Sturm Graz</p>
<p>After dominating the previous round against SK Sturm Graz, the regional victors of the DFB Pokal 2019 will face off in another storied titanic finale in Salzburg on Tuesday, 27th January. It is arguably the most epic derby in Europe following the massive tie up between SK Sturm Graz and Borussia Dortmund in early 2018. The season between the two teams has been dominated by massive personality clashes and upsets until the end of the season. Salzburg has created a convincing win and will look to cap off 2019 with another challenge against Sturm Graz, who only recently returned from a two-year hiatus.</p>
<p>The game for both teams in Salzburg is based around two mega players, Alexander Anelka and Benjamin Pavard. In terms of form, both players have been on a tear since joining the club back in 2017, with this season Anelka scoring five goals and aiding the team further in the title defence. By contrast, Pavard has missed a lot of time at the helm, but still managed to pick up a fine haul of assists. Having scored just one goal in 2018, the Frenchman will be looking to get back to the form he displayed during his time at New York City.</p>
<p>The two managers were clear to work through the current form of both players over the course of the season. For the Salzburg boss Anelka has also stated a three-game unbeaten streak for the young Russian in his pursuit of a treble, something he will be hoping to start in this game. Along with Anelka, Sturm Graz will also be boosted greatly by the return of Mario Gotze, who has been sidelined since suffering a nasty injury in the season opener. With only Salzburg’s strong away form and their favourable recent point haul in games away from home, this should be a fairly big game for both managers, depending on who wins and loses. What’s more, should Sturm Graz overcome the challenge in form and force an early finish, they will more than likely extend their unbeaten streak to five and leapfrog Salzburg in the final standings after these two games.</p>
