<p>We&amp;#x27;ve seen another example of a company that I strongly recommend trying - Flanne Lingerie. Their women have always been on a mission and I love their stuff that they sell.</p>

I&amp;#x27;m still sleeping, so here is the shirt! It&amp;#x27;ll be back with the real outfit this week!<br>
.........<br>
I swear it&amp;#x27;s just the two of us and I&amp;#x27;m SO excited to go and get it!<br>
.........<br>
Kissa, as always, your shop is one of my absolute favorites. Hope you get lots of well-wishes and many compliments!<br>
Cheers :)<br>

<p>I just wanted to tell everyone about this shirt - it was the first time I ever laughed buying something a friend recommended and was so happy to get my $20 from them! I even got some of the patches that I showed you before!</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>This post is a result of my just finishing wearing the item! I wasn&amp;#x27;t sure how I would feel wearing a shirt decorated in Lucky you All, but that did make all the difference! It feels so very good to finally own my signature clothing and I feel so good!!!</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>I was really impressed by how nice this shirt looked and how comfortable it looked on me. I know they usually sell really cheap and I always get to try out the best on me that they are selling, but I can say this, the Flanne Lingerie shirt is the best I have bought (a close second to the Lanova t-shirt). If they didn&amp;#x27;t make the Flanne Lingerie shirt, they sure should!</p>
