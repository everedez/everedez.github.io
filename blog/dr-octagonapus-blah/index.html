<h1>Dr Octagonapus Blah</h1>
<p>She-Ra and the Princess of Power are on a secret mission: spy on a pair of secret societies which are not to be trusted. But what does the Princess of Power actually want? Will her daughter be able to stop the imminent doom of the universe and can she make it back in time?</p>
<p>The Princess of Power is a former Princess of Adalise, one of the five princesses of this the Galactic Princess Academy. She was captured by a mysterious organization called the Imperial Order due to the force of her love for her childhood sweetheart, Dr Octagonapus Blah. Despite the immense pressure that has been put on her, she seems to be always motivated to find a way to achieve her destiny.</p>
<p>Dr Octagonapus Blah is a female octopus of unknown gender, by the name of, &amp;quot;Octagonapus Blah&amp;quot;. Being one of the most powerful individuals at the planet of the Galaxy, the Imperial Order created the mission of the princesses to the galactic empire to stop him.</p>
<p>Before the princesses can succeed in their endeavor, however, there is a third party who is not only intent on a betrayal of the Galactic Empire, but also working with the order. Is this the Illuminati they say?</p>
<p>Who is this third party and what does he or she represent? It will be up to the Princess of Power to find out.</p>
