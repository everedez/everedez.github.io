THE AFRICAN MOVEMENT TO BLACK SANCTUARY AT HOME AND ABROAD<br>

<p>“The house was on the outskirts of town, between two houses, and he met at the house with an older Afro-American man named John Anderson who’s a lawyer. He told him that there was this little place that had been made illegal by the government, that it was inside a very, very, very sacred and quiet village called New San Francisco. It was very, very old and there was this church where the prayers were said. And the people had been there for centuries, only they were changed by the white man for his own convenience. And it is not known what it was, but they said they’d never seen that place before. And the Afro-American man said, ‘You can’t do that, we don’t go there.’ (In the house) was a child who was named Noah Barker.”</p>
<p>That’s Noah Barker, the one and only black showbiz actor turned actor turned Hollywood heavy on the Pulp Fiction set. And Barker is an avid #TeamJameire, a hashtag so beloved by “Lip!” because of its love of one white actor who loves to “be more than a role.”</p>
<p>We started out to find the source of LIP’s love for one white actor who loves to love be black. But I found the source as a black Southern American teenager and his reasons for wanting to become an actor were different.</p>
<p>Barker, who was a self published author and record store owner until he was 19 years old and left a relationship with his former lover, was everything the internet would know as black Hollywood in the early 2000’s. Now, we arrive at today, 11 years after the blog was born and Barker is still at it, still be an actor, still loved.</p>
