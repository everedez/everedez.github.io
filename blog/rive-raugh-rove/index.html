<h1>Rive Raugh Rove</h1>
<p>Thanks to Blacken&amp;#x27;s help, we now understand the core of this story: Rove is under a cloud -- potentially in huge amounts -- and he is worried he would be indicted. In the interest of removing that cloud, it is time for everybody else to help move forward. Now that Rive Raugh has produced the story we need somebody to run against Rove.</p>
<p>After months of silence, it was announced Tuesday in St. Louis that Rove has been stricken with a congenital learning disability which causes him to largely use a dyslexic and illiterate speech pattern. His birth in 1969 with parents of German Jewish parents in Chicago, Illinois and his full name is Bob Cristian Rove. We&amp;#x27;ve known since 1993 that he is, obviously, under investigation.</p>
<p>So that&amp;#x27;s certainly an issue. What type of charges can Obama plan to bring against Rove which will allow him to be removed from politics permanently? According to a report in Time, his first priority will be to eliminate his partnership and political power in the White House. That&amp;#x27;s not surprising really; Obama has his limits after all. From Time:</p>
<p>Obama wants to dissolve Rove’s clout. Obama told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that he’ll make Rove “scrub the Capitol,” suggesting he will eventually take control of U.S. attorney offices and chair Senate filibusters for him, while he’d overhaul the structure of the federal courts and seek the elimination of the independent Counsel and Commission.</p>
<p>At a minimum, Obama plans to remove Rove, who would then need no longer be involved with political activity. Anything short of that puts that person in danger of being tossed in the slammer. This could be his strategy; he&amp;#x27;s very adept at taking down people who are politically significant. And without getting impeached or convicted the subsequent pardon, he could remain in the job, perhaps even in office.</p>
<p>As far as what Obama&amp;#x27;s ultimate plans are, I suspect President Obama is going to help by figuring out whether Rove is politically significant enough to be thrown out. As this was written an impeachment in the House seems to be almost certain; it&amp;#x27;s easy to imagine Obama removing Rove, then using him as a bargaining chip for his eventual presidency.</p>
<p>Anyone else think it would be wise to end this now?</p>
