<h1>Cody Rigsby Power And Flow</h1>
<p>On September 23rd, in the Texas border town of El Paso, a baby was born into the midst of a massive border surge of more than 1.8 million fleeing from El Salvador to attempt to reach the United States — or, in desperation, to attempt to stay on the path of the caravan. Whether it was part of the border wall, or was ignored as asylum seekers trudged into the sea of blue, it was yet another unplanned scene.</p>
<p>There was no sign that this baby was from the caravan and the baby was strapped to a beach blanket, within eyeshot of the crush, and being laughed at, and booed, and yelled at, on the shoreline. There was no sign that this baby even wanted to be here. It was a human baby, stillborn.</p>
<p>Cody Rigsby said he doesn’t care what people want to say about him, that he is an American patriot, and he’s here to make sure that no American child dies in the last days of the Trump Administration in a border policy that even the president himself admits is cruel, hateful, and heartless.</p>
<p>Despite this, he’s already noticed that the children of El Salvador have no place in the US, and he’s frustrated that when they do show up, they get cut down by the border patrol or are shot by Mexican police, or a coyote cuts them down so that others can step up and claim them.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the children in the caravan that the Rigsby family are caring for. They’ve been sent $36,600 to care for the family’s son now, thanks to the El Paso Human Rights Council. Because they want to be sure that at least one Salvadoran child dies in vain. While the rest of El Paso is home.</p>
<p>It all started more than a year ago, when the Oceanside migrant community of Central American families, known as coyotes, showed up. Everyone from El Salvador to Guatemala to Honduras thought it was a big deal. For them, it was a chance to come to America and escape the “undesired destiny” of their homelands. They thought more would come, so they all returned.</p>
<p>They all returned because.</p>
