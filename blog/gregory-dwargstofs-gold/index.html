<h1>Gregory Dwargstofs Gold</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A year ago I had this idea of a run for the SCG Cup with my friends Arun Srivastav and Saerim Iqbal. The entire SCG had come with us, and I had a great fun time playing with my friends.</p>
<p>Once I got done with that run I thought about how I wanted to continue it but how to handle the SCG schedule and the struggle of making it to the SCG Cup in 2019.</p>
<p>First off, I thought that I should make a best of every format I come across with my run for the SCG Cup. It won’t be a short run though as it will be far longer than I intended. I’m a big fan of long runs, but I have a lot to prove after the SCG Cup which is hard to do on a normal SCG run; especially when there’s a stage like the Six-String which is just 6 tiers up.</p>
<p>I decided to pick my favourite formats for the first part of 2018 and create a run to which I had fun playing. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2>Black/White Six-String Stumps</h2>
<p>We had set up our run in one of our favourite formats where 3+ players take turns running through the Six-String consisting of 4 five-star formats each. There are also 3 star formats and 1-star formats. Those 6 different 6-string formats are split between 2 players for the first 20 rounds with one player retiring in the fourth round. Each of those players takes one of those formats.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the two formats we had used the longest time-wise. We used 5+ players and a Two-Stump. We gave our favourite player the win and one of his opponents. We didn’t even require the order being “A”, “B”, “C”, “A”, “B”, “C” etc. We just gave that player the win. The two formats he chose were BOTTOM and GIGANTOM (2×2). The other two formats were A and 1×5. We gave these a shot because we had already played them the long version.</p>
