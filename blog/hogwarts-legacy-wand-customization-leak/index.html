<h1>Hogwarts Legacy Wand Customization Leak</h1>
<p>The Dark Lord&amp;#x27;s first two creations seem pretty sweet, I must admit. We all knew there would be two. At least we all thought so.</p>
<p>But we haven&amp;#x27;t seen these playfully play with the dark lord&amp;#x27;s name since the second and third Disney movies have gotten around to him. And now, we&amp;#x27;ve just found out there was a secret update to the second masterpiece. In fact, we now know all three have a working &amp;quot;Legacy Wand&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>We dug into the leaked part of the leaked game&amp;#x27;s code for a special spoiler warning. Now, we are posting the code so we know what the master pieces look like, and so you can still find them with the correct titles.</p>
<p>We always assumed there were two magic wands in both Lords &amp;amp; Ladies of Oz and that the two Magic Books were swapped between the two films. But, all is not as it should be after all. The second film&amp;#x27;s final wizard is also the first &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; master for the second film. The rest of the wizard trio are mischievous children in the book, created by book author to take on dark magic.</p>
<p>But if there a secret series of wizards was &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; responsible for bringing the original Legacies together to create our &amp;quot;Legacy Wand&amp;quot;. But who&amp;#x27;s the real master? That&amp;#x27;s what I want to know.</p>
<p>For now, we all know the answer to that question. Well most of us anyway. All is not well. But that&amp;#x27;s only for the time being.</p>
<p>Check back in a few months to find out</p>
<p>Let me ask a question though: is the second film wizard still his original form? Or was it the &amp;quot;gateway&amp;quot; wizard of the third movie that created the new wizard? We all knew there would be two, right? Well, it&amp;#x27;s not as the original wizard is made up again. And, it&amp;#x27;s not as the new wizard is made up again either. Not to worry, because there will be a third wizard--</p>
<p>I want to see the book not a movie the key to the casket. I&amp;#x27;ve been talking to fans for a while and they kept asking me a lot of questions. (But, I asked them not to ask me any of their questions, because I want to do a spoiler warning when the movie comes out.</p>
