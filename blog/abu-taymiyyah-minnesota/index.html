<h1>Abu Taymiyyah Minnesota</h1>
<h3>History and Art</h3>
<p>A relatively new cultural center in a modern setting, with an innovative Islamic education initiative. The center has been located downtown on the second level from the Public Bridge and a bike path around the block. The Islamic center features several mosaic stained glass windows and some intricate doors made from glass. The facility was renovated in a 2015 art-deco style. The grounds are a hub for various activities surrounding the center and in the neighborhood. They feature a bazaar, volleyball court, swimming pool, nature center, and a fitness center.</p>
<p>The center features some renowned Egyptian poets like Ahmed Farouk Gharey, Ali b. Faris; the American poet, Henry Miller and the poet Shahida Rushdi.</p>
<p>Various Arabic and Islamic music CDs are available for use at the center and services for a community to meet and socialize.</p>
<p>Signs inside the center provide some information about Arabic culture such as Islamic prayers and suhada, the Islamic prayer at the end of which there is recital.</p>
<p>Throughout the facility, murals depict murals in honor of various Egyptian saints.</p>
<p>Around 50 students have received the Islamic Education Initiatives for Learning in the Arts (ILETI) Program which provides after-school and summer intensive Arabic immersion programs.</p>
<p>Located within the mosque itself is the newly built religious education center which features an interior courtyard with a central fountain. The center includes student training rooms, study rooms, auditoriums, seminar room space with plasma screens for discussion and lectures, computer support, television, and a community meeting area.</p>
<p>One of the mosque&amp;#x27;s features is an arcaded courtyard which provides a space to study Arabic with a decorative water feature in the courtyard. The courtyard also has a sauna and, in the summer months, an aquatic gym for kids to play in.</p>
<p>The facility hosts many other activities every day on weekends as well as school events and other programs. The mosque is home to an Arabic-interfaith center and also has a good collection of Iraqi and Persian books in Arabic, English, and Kurdish.</p>
