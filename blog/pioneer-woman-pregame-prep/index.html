<h1>Pioneer Woman Pregame Prep</h1>
<p>When the Chicago Bears had the week off, the Fox Network showed a long primetime interview between former Cowboys receiver George Morgan and Steelers wide receiver Priest Holmes.</p>
<p>Part two was a late segment on top-40 radio show WWMY Best of 2000.</p>
<p>The full interview with Holmes will air on the same day as the last day of a three-team NFL record-setting 50th celebration.</p>
<p>Also, another example of how Fox covers its bottom line while letting commercials do its job. Last year&amp;#x27;s Super Bowl commercials averaged less than 2 minutes of content, then after two seconds one of the Patriots plays the Seahawks on Fox.</p>
<p>And now the NFL&amp;#x27;s 50th Anniversary celebrations begin Monday night.</p>
<p>By the start, there&amp;#x27;s already no question that the NFL will be underweighted, even if it&amp;#x27;s only by the number of fans who support each of the franchises.</p>
<p>This weekend, I&amp;#x27;ll repeat what I wrote in March that &amp;quot;we should eliminate the notion that the NFL is &amp;#x27;only for Americans&amp;#x27;&amp;quot; and instead focus on whether &amp;quot;these teams are really about sports.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>One interesting twist is that the NFL is getting some positive press from a lot of people outside the traditional media. The Washington Post columnist Michelle Bittner has produced a piece on one of the most hated teams of all time.</p>
<p>Another piece to note is that people who have never been an NFL fan can, at least for a night, see the games they&amp;#x27;ve long been unable to. The Mariners are playing the Los Angeles Dodgers, a game the Mariners swept in Kansas City last year. The high-bidding contest for Game 2 starts at 7 p.m. on NBC.</p>
<p>One veteran writer suggested that the audience should see a classic game and have the idea of a rivalry brought back with the opening series between the Texas and Kansas City Wild.</p>
<p>And the Oakland Athletics are in Philadelphia, playing the Phillies, the only non-MLS team in the Western Conference. They beat the Philadelphia Phillies in 1968 (1937 if you count 1920), but that was the old National League.</p>
<p>Time to rethink the franchise and start looking at the marketing strategy.</p>
