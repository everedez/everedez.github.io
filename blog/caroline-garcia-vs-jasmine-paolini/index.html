This is crazy!
Really this was all my fault.

<h1>Caroline Garcia Vs Jasmine Paolini</h1>
<p>Ms Pàngan “Pàng”, you have to believe me, all this has been a nightmare. She hasn’t laughed in years, hasn’t laughed in all of these years and at this point I am starting to fear she’s gone completely mad.</p>
<p>This is crazy!</p>
<p>Really this was all my fault.</p>
<p>“Jasmine”, you have to believe me, this was all my fault, like you know what that means please believe me there is no way I could have known such a crazy person would go through such a very messy divorce. I could have lost her completely!</p>
<p>Remember how nervous I was? Remember how scared? What a complete idiot I was. You see I went out to the bar to get a glass of wine to cheer myself up after this huge mess. I know God had this moment with Caroline and she accepted it in her heart that this is how it’s going to be and I threw her not losing her as a sister and now look what I’ve done, I’ve totally blown it, I’ve ruined all our chances of getting back together. And when it’s all said and done Caroline will be a horrible mess. Honestly, does anyone really believe that Caroline and I will ever be together again?</p>
<p>The thought of being “rehabilitated” is horrifying. We live in a culture that has accepted that getting a good guy with an ego is going to be easy.</p>
<p>This was easier said than done but no one forced us, no one was there to babysit and try and make it work. This was Caroline’s life.</p>
<p>It all happened like this, I just woke up and realized I had no control.</p>
<p>I had no say in it.</p>
<p>Like I said, I’ve always thought I would need someone who I could look up to the way I was raising kids. Someone who would be better at life than I. Someone who is going to be there for me even if it’s just from a distance.</p>
