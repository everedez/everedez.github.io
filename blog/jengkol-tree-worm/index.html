<h1>Jengkol Tree Worm</h1>
<p>The Jengkol Tree Worm is a fascinating biological anomaly. It is the only animal to survive a very harsh environment in the tropics. Most animals are killed quickly by predators and the damage to their growth in a tropical jungle is almost beyond belief but this tree worm has survived for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The jengkol is a large flat worm usually seen as wormlike animals having eight legs which are covered in glandular hairs that are constantly moving on long, mobile black spines. The worms prefer lush forests or holes in the forest floor. The jengkol is usually 20cm or greater in length. Males reach up to 25cm and females up to 10cm. The worms have no eyes. they are mostly blind. and very difficult to see while walking. These animals are not aggressive and do not show aggression toward any other type of life. This is probably what saved them for thousands of years. Although not studied, the jengkol would also be unable to feed on flesh because no flesh is present.</p>
<p>Structure of the jengkol is similar to that of many other sponges and simply allows them to live in the area. This gives them a stability and strength that no other animal can have.</p>
<p>The worm is covered with fine protoplasmic material called argyra that gives the worm its great structural strength. The jengkol also grows without the use of waste.</p>
<p>The jengkol can be controlled by insects, but as a result of human disturbance, often over-harvest and dumping of waste, the jengol are now being killed by the pest.</p>
<p>Scientists are struggling to understand what is causing this strange group of animals to be in trouble. The researchers believe the primary cause is the limited dispersal of light allowing for other toxins to destroy the parasites of the jengkol.</p>
<p>If this theory is true, the next step would be to test the compound that the organisms need to create this toxic compound as other organisms with very different lifestyles require it to survive.</p>
<p>The latest research indicates the possible dangers to the jengkol are not as severe as originally thought. The researchers are hoping to improve the survival rate of the jengkol so that they can breed fast to keep them in good condition in the tropics.</p>
