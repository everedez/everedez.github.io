We haven&amp;#x27;t heard much from the Big 5 today. Seems the school Board is hiding them away somewhere. According to a news item out of Davenport, IA the school is delayed because the Big 5 thinks enough snow has fallen to continue as expected to school later this week.
In Davenport, the school is 2-3 days late because the district didn&amp;#x27;t plow enough roads.">

<h1>Wboc School Delays Today</h1>
<p>
Edwardsville, IL | Tuesday, January 10th, 2010<br>
BEGINNING.<br>
*      *      *      *      *<br>
</p>
<p>We haven&amp;#x27;t heard much from the Big 5 today. Seems the school Board is hiding them away somewhere. According to a news item out of Davenport, IA the school is delayed because the Big 5 thinks enough snow has fallen to continue as expected to school later this week.</p>
<p>In Davenport, the school is 2-3 days late because the district didn&amp;#x27;t plow enough roads. In the Rock River PPR, PPR has delayed their school schedule again. According to the print edition, there were multiple potholes on school property on the north and east side of the school.</p>
<p>The Northeast 4/5 has delayed again. According to a dispatch in Davenport the school has not gotten to its normal starting time, it has started 7 minutes late. A reporter in Logan, IA also says the school missed several weeks due to this. The Southwest 4/5 has been delayed 3/4 times and the Southwest 4/5/6 has been delayed 4 times.</p>
<p>Seward district is citing a lot of schools including PPR that have starting times that are up to a few minutes off. But Seward says they don&amp;#x27;t cancel plans that far ahead.</p>
<p>So again, there has to be something here. Maybe we&amp;#x27;ll get another &amp;quot;Big 5&amp;quot; report.</p>
<p>Liaise, Iowa, a town 16 miles southwest of Davenport got 4 more words in today&amp;#x27;s newspaper today.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;ve made a mental note to get that in every paper that has a sports page! Stay safe and check with the Web site to follow later today.</p>
<p>And not too much sleep. So I&amp;#x27;m on a bad Internet connection, with a fair amount of bad energy.</p>
<p>Don&amp;#x27;t go home tonight. Go out to work. Follow up on the story by doing some checking.</p>
<p>And those are the words of Edwardsville Today. Thank you.</p>
