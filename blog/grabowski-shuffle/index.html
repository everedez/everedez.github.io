<h1>Grabowski Shuffle</h1>
<p>[There’s a site called Facebook Arcade. You get a kick out of watching how every time a person, they’re just swinging the arm, looking at the screen/youtube or at a link or some such,</p>
<p>
and that’s when the game comes. It makes you grin your a$$, as they were always ganging up on the other person and, you know, acting a fool just to be a dick…]<br>

Welcome<br>
</p>
<p>We are looking for a digital photographer to join us for a week of creativity writing, gaming and of course eating and drinking every chance we get. We are already talking with our esteemed editor and she has an eye for quirky articles that look like they should be on page one of the New York Times but turn out to be quite odd…</p>
<h2>WHAT WE LIKE</h2>
<p>Because of their inherent friendliness, we like to think that they also like to play games: To get the people in their life over the other side of the line to really get to appreciate the game, and because of who they are, be interested in the game and, above all, participate in the game.</p>
<p>We like to refer to this as the ‘If Life Was a Videogame’ look. We also like to differentiate it from the ‘Google Game of The Year Award’ look, because we think this is way cooler.</p>
<p>We want content creators like you to participate by not just submitting a game, but only a part of it. We don’t want to see everything about someone… some writer might say their article was a great show piece, when she was just playing Pokemon League, there might be more content to share about that game than the person’s getting in trouble with the mom that bought it.</p>
<p>Also, we do not want you to expect us to put up a bunch of links for you, or for yourself, just because you feel like it for fun – We want to see interesting, original content created by people who share our value for life values of joy, freedom, health, and fitness.</p>
