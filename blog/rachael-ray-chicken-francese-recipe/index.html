<h1>Rachael Ray Chicken Francese Recipe</h1>
<p>Criminals, (like most of us), tend to find joy in the downfall of others.</p>
<p>And fortunately, not all of us are as rotten of morals as he is.</p>
<p>He’s a nice man that drives a truck, has a wife, a very nice collection of paintings (which are good ), and no kids. And just like that; he loses his truck. Yep, that’s what happens.</p>
<p>He decided to drive a new truck, one his big friend wanted, but that didn’t quite work out for him. The guy didn’t, however, pass out while driving on a highway. (The sky was turning orange and purple.) Well what can you do? Nothing. These are the folks you read about in the news.</p>
<p>Rachael’s friend wanted to trade him his truck, but wanted it for a bit cheaper than what his friend could get him. They parted on good terms, and he took the truck, figuring he could use it in a new and better way. The weather was just a bit lighter, he drove to Florida, and voila! That’s a new truck. If he wanted to take all this, he found a friend in the trucking industry that would give him work. (How good are you, Mr. Bad Guy?)</p>
<p>The little trucker planned on taking it to one of his buddies who worked for a fleet trucking company in the area. So he hightailed it, and drove with his buddy to the garage where he was going to drive the truck, which he was taking to the friends. This would have been a swell deal, but for that part of the exchange. He wanted it to be quick, and he was worried about rain. Well he was able to be all in all! He bought it at a good price, and drove home with his new truck, all the while having to deal with the rain. Everything was worth it.</p>
<p>Not long before the sun was coming up with these people in the sky (with the clouds hanging lower than usual), he rode the truck down to his grandmother’s house with the truck in tow. He’d spent the evening at a bar, so he usually ate out that night, so he was in a mess.</p>
