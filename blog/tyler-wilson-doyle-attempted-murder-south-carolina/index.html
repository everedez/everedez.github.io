<h1>Tyler Wilson Doyle Attempted Murder South Carolina</h1>
<h3>July 19, 1998</h3>
<p>Mr. C.D. West, a lawyer, and I left our home in Clemson, South Carolina and drove</p>
<p>
to North Charleston, South Carolina at the same time. While the North Charleston Police<br>
Department and the Cremation Authority were very cooperative throughout the meeting,<br>
I asked the South Carolina State Highway Patrol to inquire as to what was taking Mr. Wilson<br>
</p>
<p>Doyle so long. The Patrol stopped our car, and Mr. Wilson Doyle, a South Carolina</p>
<p>
crematory rep, pulled up on our side of the road. Mr. Wilson Doyle then told Mr.<br>
C.D. West that my clients had gone into another one of those coffins that they put in.<br>
He then threw his keys into a nearby garbage can and attempted to leave the scene of his<br>
attack. It is my belief that he had been drinking alcohol. Mr. West asked Mr.<br>
Wilson Doyle to come to my office, where I suggested that Mr. Doyle come into the<br>
office for a conference. Mr. Doyle remained in disbelief on several occasions, asking &amp;quot;Why<br>
would that happen to me?&amp;quot; Mr. Wilson Doyle had the keys to our car when he was<br>
taken into custody. I believe that when this happened, the Sheriff&amp;#x27;s Department was<br>
in a bad situation that they not only wanted the defendants to pay for the cost of<br>
the illegal detention of defendant but that they wanted the defendants&amp;#x27; attorneys<br>
to be involved and &amp;quot;make it look like we did the best we could.&amp;quot;<br>
R.H., 1998 WL 408937 at *3.<br>
</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle&amp;#x27;s trial began in January 1998 and lasted until February 1998. During this</p>
<p>
time, on October 2, 1998, his trial counsel brought this motion to suppress certain evidence<br>
offered in a pretrial motion to suppress. In this motion, Mr. Doyle&amp;#x27;s trial counsel claimed<br>
that the evidence was obtained in violation of Mr.<br>
