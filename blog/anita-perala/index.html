<h1>Anita Perala</h1>
<p>A week into her time in office, Narendra Modi’s BJP government has set in motion the first of its kind measures against the Left and LGBT+ ideology espoused by the BJP-led United Democratic Front.</p>
<p>One such measure being taken came on Friday when the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MEFC) gave a one-month deadline for the Kerala government to make an announcement on the issue of entry of farmers and dalits into the flood-prone coastal regions.</p>
<p>The federal government had issued an interim injunction on June 7, ordering the Kerala Government to inform the Centre of the ban of all “illegal and temporary entry” of local farmers, including those in big or small sized, into the coastal areas.</p>
<p>In this case, besides the crop being grown by farmers, the government also wanted to differentiate the persons who fall under the category of “illegal and temporary entry”.</p>
<p>“The government has directed the authority concerned, MEFC, not to allow any ‘temporary entry’ like buying cattle from abroad, sale of livestock or renting,” a government statement issued on Friday said.</p>
<p>The state unit of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam had filed an application before the Kerala High Court of April 28 for the temporary ban of entry of farmers into coastal areas.</p>
<p>Centre and Opposition react</p>
<p>The Centre and opposition parties in India reacted with surprise to the Government’s order which was made official by the MEF. “Such a letter should be suspended immediately, it should be made explicit,” Defence Minister Arun Jaitley said.</p>
<p>Kerala Chief Minister Omprakashin Sudheeran reacted with shock by stating, “Temporary entry ban for private parties is illegal and unprecedented.”</p>
<p>UP CM Rahul Gandhi and Congress Lok Sabha leader and Minister of State for State in the PMO Ajayi Nijhawan also slammed the MEF order. “There should be no such exemption given to any party or group and for that decision the government needs to take note.”</p>
<p>The BJP leader on Friday said, “We are also not against the entry of farmers and labourers into coastal areas.”</p>
<p>Left Front also took to Twitter to try and explain the government’s position.</p>
