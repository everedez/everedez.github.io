<h2>Personality &amp;amp; Personality Development :</h2>
<p>
Likes to annoy her companions.<br>
Wants the world to see her in a very strange dress.<br>
Hates being a role-model for young girls.<br>
</p>
<p>Daughter of : Dr. So-Ho who grew up in Korea before moving to the US, has a 4 year older sister and an older brother as well</p>
<h2>Character Developments :</h2>
<h3>Daughter Of :</h3>
<p>Daughter Of : Dr. So-Ho grew up in the US, but immigrated to Korea as a high-schooler, and as such was a child of immigrant parents. She entered the country hoping to work for the war workers, but quit when she discovered that most of the war victims had no family. She married to a Korean contractor, who worked out on two boats during WWII</p>
<p>After returning to Korea and learning more about her parents and family history, she decided she didn&amp;#x27;t want to be a role model for young girls and instead wanted to support the soldiers and others who made sacrifices and marched far away from home due to the fear of the unknown. While she works for the army, she frequently takes young boys/girls, who call her&amp;#x27;mommy&amp;#x27; (Korean-speak: 한인 ) to hide the fact that they are pretty much creepy and the behavior is unnatural. She also takes care of her younger cousins whom are in the government and are the only source of her income</p>
<p>At age 32, she is no longer a role-model since it is unlikely for her to have any children who will have one. Her life has changed considerably as she is no longer financially independent and is helping others who have no income. She fights the urges to explore other states of existence, since many of them are a great love and she cannot really know them.</p>
<p>Likes to annoy her companions.She has a 3 year-old son.</p>
<p>Loves her job in the public office and works hard at it despite it being a really boring position.</p>
