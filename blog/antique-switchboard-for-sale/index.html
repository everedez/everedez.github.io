<h1>Antique Switchboard For Sale</h1>
<p>Possion to get rid of these disassembled hands on switches and reuse them for a variety of applications. We have one hands-on cabinet here which we have plans to completely disassemble, clean out and rebuild with brand new gear.</p>
<p>On the sales end we are looking for someone that is familiar with old vintage gear, has the drive to master those old (but very good to restore) switches with a modicum of professional craftsmanship, and have the additional necessary skill of knowing how to rebuild them and keep them in top operating condition.</p>
<p>If you think you may be the right kind of someone who really will have the hands to do it all, please do get back to us pronto!</p>
<p>I will put together a shortlist of a few dozen switches that we feel would work best for this project. My primary goal is getting something that would fit within budget and find a market.</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns, concerns, questions, or have a favorite switch, let me know and I will see if i can help.</p>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>This looks like it would be a good candidate for a small collection. I will say that these switches were not all that expensive from the cabinet they were installed in and they served many of the same use and function.</p>
<p>The cabinet I have is not especially full and it is likely that they did not need a lot of pulling. To fit them in it has had no effort to fill it. The cabinet itself is used and I had them wrapped before I disassembled them to avoid anything getting in the cracks.</p>
<p>This article is rather long and I could easily not go through it all. I would suggest posting a photo and getting a progress report from you in a separate article. I&amp;#x27;ve always been under the impression that taking some photos are a part of the game.</p>
<p>I am open to ideas. Please let me know of anything else that is not clear or comes right across in the comments below. In the meantime here are some switches shown:</p>
<p>With the additional info from the original article on the subject I did incorporate the other hand-on switches as well. As far as a collection goes I had many different systems in mind. There could be dozens of other switches that can be used.</p>
