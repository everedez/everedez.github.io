<h1>Wraith Dark And Darker</h1>
<p>Skies are always dark, I always wondered about it, no wonder people cry and cry and cry on this Dark one day scene showing a street crowded with people strolling around a beautiful woman, it almost looks like a star, there is a faint blue and silver curtain showing the full moon smiling up at them - a familiar feeling (At the very least it seems like...)</p>
<p>This shows an old kind of day in the Cretan Islands where the sky was bright, a day when everything seemed to glow, a day when it almost seemed like a fairytale... It is always dark. We spend our leisure time dancing, it is just not dark enough.</p>
<p>Not so much in this screenshot, see next line and note that all of the names in this film are names familiar to me - just the names, not actual references to how each scene was shot.</p>
<p>I wonder if the director meant more subtle references, perhaps meaning some subtle yet major changes in the stories, like having the mother and father, son, and uncle cast together, or calling for the girl to come to the night market just after dinner.</p>
<p>I have never seen the night market. I understand that this has a &amp;#x27;coolness&amp;#x27; to it, but as soon as I read that it is in cretan, it seems cold... It is always dark. We spend our leisure time dancing, it is just not dark enough.This screenshot shows an old kind of day in the Cretan Islands where the sky was bright, a day when everything seemed to glow, a day when it almost seemed like a fairytale...
