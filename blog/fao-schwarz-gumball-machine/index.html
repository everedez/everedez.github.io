Joffrey Thomas described what happened when he took his machine out of the factory and tried it. He said, “I was holding it with both hands. I knew I could start it with it’s frame set against its back frame. From this moment onwards, I had no control, and everything was all my own. I felt like I was dealing with a black hole.">

<p>Joffrey Thomas described what happened when he took his machine out of the factory and tried it. He said, “I was holding it with both hands. I knew I could start it with it’s frame set against its back frame. From this moment onwards, I had no control, and everything was all my own. I felt like I was dealing with a black hole. It was so powerful, I could barely keep a hold on it and I was basically covered in ink. The more I struggled to control it, the more I could feel it growing bigger and bigger. Eventually, I couldn’t stand it any longer, and my voice faded away, my heartbeat slowed down and my body turned to lead.”</p>
<p>“I struggled and struggled to control a gigantic mowing machine built of almost nothing but cotton. I pushed it with everything I had. Eventually I couldn’t keep my hands off it anymore and I nearly fell over. The feeling I got was so powerful I felt like I might fall over dead. Then, slowly, I felt myself drifting off into a yellow-tinged world. My heart was still racing, but it was fading. I was surprised to feel myself falling but I didn’t fall out of the machine. I slowly caught my breath, and soon I regained my senses and the cotton shivered and broke apart in my hands. Once again, I found myself floating freely in a world full of cotton, sound and movement. I lay there in my cotton while I felt the cool air flowing in and out of my nose and mouth, and slowly slowly I felt myself gaining strength.</p>
<p>​While I was growing stronger I knew I would have to stop. I stopped fighting but before I knew it I was knocked out, unconscious and drifting away. The next thing I knew the wind kicked up which I was used to even though I didn’t like it. I rolled over onto my back and the next thing I knew, my lungs and heart weren’t beating. I saw a blur of light and was lifted into the air once again.</p>
