Description
Since the fall of communism, Venezuela has remained one of the most powerful nations in Latin America. Because of the economic embargo of the socialist regime, many of the citizens of that country have considered emigrating away, but thanks to the combination of political savvy, economic pragmatism and technological expertise, Curaçao is now the best option for those leaving Venezuela.">

Cuba - Cuba vs Curazao Hoy<br>

Description<br>
</p>
<p>Since the fall of communism, Venezuela has remained one of the most powerful nations in Latin America. Because of the economic embargo of the socialist regime, many of the citizens of that country have considered emigrating away, but thanks to the combination of political savvy, economic pragmatism and technological expertise, Curaçao is now the best option for those leaving Venezuela.</p>
<p>Cuba, the last region with a large Venezuelan population, is still a relatively young destination. However, its capital city Havana is fast becoming an attractive destination for Latin American Hispanics and Caribbean Americans. After spending a while playing with the Latin Kings of Curaçao, who are more successful than the Curaçao who were the previous main opponents in the Caribbean, the Las Vegas Strip has seen a surge of interest from the Curaçao market.</p>
<p>Why would the Curaçao want to play for the Las Vegas Strip since the government has imposed a sanctions on them? Well, they are on the way to victory in their bid to become the new main threat in the Caribbean. With the current status of Curaçao as the last good little islands in the ocean that are owned by a socialist government, the Curaçao politicians realize that the new generation of Curaçao is currently stronger than their predecessors and are the most likely to take advantage of their position if the government denies Curaçao access to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>For some reason, Curaçao wants to be considered a challenger to the Spanish Crown and to lead by example of making sure that the socialist dictatorship is a minor player in the world and that the tiny country can win over bigger countries in international tournaments without a problem.</p>
<p>In a country that is just 942 kilometers long, Curaçao has been famous for its charm for centuries. With a population of around 905,000 Curaçaoers, it has the longest coastline among members of the Antillean Union. It was recognized as an independent nation by Great Britain in 1632 and is only the 15th of the 19 countries, including the U.S.S.R, that have become independent nation-states.</p>
