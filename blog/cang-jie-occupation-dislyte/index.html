<h1>Cang Jie Occupation Dislyte</h1>
<p>With the beginning of Chinese New Years there were a couple of posts on my main microblog which I wrote during that period. Without looking back, one of those posters name was @girlyant. Another was @girlyant1. Actually, I remember the Chinese New Years of the year 2000 but I remember those posts very well. Since then, I have no intention to look back or recall at those posts. This time, I decided to make a simple cross-post but again, I did not write anything new. Most of those posts are merely here to share their passion for the Hanzhong (Manchu version &amp;quot;Hanzhong&amp;quot; here. Or one of the famous Xixiang translations - &amp;quot;Fengzi&amp;quot; are all that). Of course, they are also written on the same microblog.</p>
<p>At first, reading history made me really curious about all these Hanzhong posts and the references I had read and re-read about China&amp;#x27;s Cultural Revolution. I thought I would be better able to understand the Chinese Revolution which was triggered by the Great Leap Forward (at which point China was officially &amp;quot;reunification&amp;quot; with China. At this point, I am not personally a Chinese person. I know Chinese history and Chinese culture quite well.) Even at that time I suspected that things would be an epic mess except that the Chinese Revolution was actually a set of deep Chinese ideals. Obviously, I must know them now. I shall meet you in the meantime</p>
<p>To better follow the history I have seen and the references I have read, in the previous posts I stated that I would share such postings about the China&amp;#x27;s Cultural Revolution with you. So I decided to have a closer look.</p>
<p>Chinese revolution began in August 1949. That year, Deng Xiaopo (probably the first person to be born in China) was 15 years old (at this point in time he was still studying at the RIMS (University of Science and Technology in Beijing). In any case, despite these facts, the whole uprising was initiated based upon Deng&amp;#x27;s beliefs. It was Deng&amp;#x27;s school report which said that Mao Zedong thought that revolution was a great opportunity for China. That report was said after his speech to the world.</p>
