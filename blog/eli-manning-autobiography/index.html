<h1>Eli Manning Autobiography</h1>
<p>
by Ben McCormickonJune 1, 2013<br>
&amp;quot;All these years at the center of the NFL, with the help of our wonderful<br>
guys, I realize I put together this record-breaking offense that somehow<br>
went through a process of losing a bunch of players and a lot of<br>
integrity to it, and looking for a way to do our jobs – pretty<br>
ridiculous because I&amp;#x27;m the quarterback, and I didn&amp;#x27;t have a chance of<br>
passing under my own power – not what you want, but what you want is<br>
running this system for not just a game but for a show that they wouldn&amp;#x27;t<br>
stand for me doing my job the way I usually do it.&amp;quot;<br>
During the 2012 season (which became Eli&amp;#x27;s second rushing campaign of his<br>
first three years in San Francisco) the Giants were at their lowest point in<br>
their existence, with a 6-7 record, a 9-7 final record, and an 8-8 record as<br>
the defending champion. On October 28, 2012, the Giants defeated the Tampa<br>
Bay Buccaneers with 28.3 seconds left in the game to earn their first<br>
start—an all-time high in Giants’ history. While it was<br>
all-but certain San Francisco would win, a dramatic 33-33 overtime game<br>
ending in a FieldTurf football field with 42 seconds left finally had them<br>
on the brink of failure. The Giants’ backup quarterback Nick Cross scored<br>
the winning touchdown with 1:05 left after a Giants’ defender fumbled the<br>
ball and the Buccaneers recovered his own fumble to force overtime.<br>
A year later with two major changes for San Francisco, the team failed<br>
to win any regular-season or playoff games, and the worst portion of their<br>
season could be chronicled in 2011 as a Super Bowl drought. The team’s<br>
legacy can be attributed to a “don’t shoot, don’t kick” mentality that<br>
dominated their games for most of the season. In his first year as head<br>
coach, his offensive philosophy of running the ball on all plays and running<br>
only 1:52,093 of time for a total of 78 carries was similar to his approach<br>
of 2013.<br>
