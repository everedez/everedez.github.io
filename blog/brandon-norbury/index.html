<p>Brett Brown knows it&amp;#x27;s tough for Heat fans when teams are on the clock. LeBron James, Karl Malone, Udonis Haslem and Andre Miller were all gone by the time the Los Angeles Lakers picked him with the No. 9 pick in 2003, but this guy is damn good at sitting out the last few minutes. LeBron made this one and it stuck. Very live and extremely sound. [ Benjy Lopez on Twitter ]</p>
<p>LaMarcus Aldridge will miss the rest of the season because of a strained oblique.</p>
<p>We apologize for the extended absence of the NBA&amp;#x27;s best point guard in LaMarcus Aldridge, who has been sidelined with a strained oblique since losing to the San Antonio Spurs in an overtime game on Feb. 13. Aldridge has been in a recent holding pattern with the NBA Players Association despite telling the league&amp;#x27;s union he&amp;#x27;s ready to return for the Heat after missing almost 10 weeks of action with a back injury. League sources told ESPN&amp;#x27;s Adrian Wojnarowski that Aldridge will undergo season-ending surgery and likely miss the rest of the season. With Aldridge no longer with the Spurs, a source familiar with the situation told Wojnarowski that Aldridge has decided to quit because of the way he&amp;#x27;s being treated by the PAs. Aldridge&amp;#x27;s agent Tyronn Lue, the former Lakers president, issued a statement on Aldridge&amp;#x27;s health Sunday reiterating how he plans to handle Aldridge&amp;#x27;s dealings with the union. &amp;quot;It is inconceivable that we would ever allow LaMarcus to opt out of his contract,&amp;quot; Lue said. &amp;quot;He is not even capable of extending a contract with his current contract, and will be relegated to a seventh team during his time playing in Los Angeles. We wish him the very best and appreciate his effort during his four years.&amp;quot; It has been 22 months since Aldridge&amp;#x27;s last game with a team, and he has not seemed like himself until recently.</p>
