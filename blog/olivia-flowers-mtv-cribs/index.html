Hey Olivia!!!! Me again!
Now here&amp;#x27;s me feeling giddy &amp;amp; excitement about the season coming up. Who&amp;#x27;s getting the cash strapped break &amp;amp; who got it right out of their system? We can&amp;#x27;t wait to see your comments

<p>Hey Olivia!!!! Me again!</p>

<p>Re: TBR, Biggest Cuts, &amp;amp; Life &amp;amp; Career changes of Season 10! Here&amp;#x27;s the Clues! - #10</p>
<p>Congratulations on your new roles. That&amp;#x27;s the strongest of these season! I bet you are SO jealous of the new career and life changes. It is a GOOD thing to be so happy.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m doubting that anything good happens for you now because it hasn&amp;#x27;t been stated. However, that doesn&amp;#x27;t mean that you should give up on things. It could mean you are building things that you need to be doing because they just don&amp;#x27;t get done.</p>
<p>@brieker86: I don&amp;#x27;t think this season was that weak. I loved that it featured more seasons. I actually really liked most of them. They all just worked.</p>
<p>_____________________________________________________</p>
<p>#10: &amp;quot;I knew I wasn&amp;#x27;t getting fired.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>On the episode &amp;quot;Purple Friday&amp;quot;, the entire school was wearing purple during lunch break. I laughed when I saw this. You were supposed to wear the colors of your school during lunch. But I guess it didn&amp;#x27;t go over so well. I have to say that your life has changed more in the past few weeks than at any other point in your life! Your love of music and dancing has reached a whole new level! I&amp;#x27;m so proud of you!</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to having you back at NCSU and I am so glad that your friends are celebrating with you by having dinner and your own personal premiere, and not the event where people had to invite you to sing or they had to book the concert.</p>
<p>We all know you danced this week, and now you will undoubtedly dance the whole season.</p>
