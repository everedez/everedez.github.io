<h1>The Doves Vs The Ravens Comic</h1>
<p>Avery and I decided we’d draw a comic we’re pretty proud of. You can help us get this thing shown in the WSJ, on TV and radio. Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>But how can you be proud of a comic?</p>
<p>Like I said, we spent the weekend drawing this comic thing and it’s not coming out for a while. But I’ve decided to do a quick post about it for a couple of reasons. First of all, Avery and I agree that it’d be a waste to rush into a rush. (In other words, we think that it’s better to be a week late.) Also, the point is to show what really makes a comic great.</p>
<p>But to get back to my real reason, it’s to show what a great comic can look like…</p>
<h2>So Let’s Begin…</h2>
<p>When you Google “Doves Vs. Ravens,” the first first result I see is a thread about a comic that was posted over here a couple weeks ago. And it had this huge picture of the Doves…</p>
<p>…and I thought: these Doves comics could make for a fun TV show.</p>
<p>I know there’s been a lot of praise for these Doves and the way they spend their days, and how they battle the Ravens like a real, hard-nosed team. This is a realistic portrayal of these characters. It’s also a realistic portrayal of the way these two teams are so-called on TV.</p>
<p>
And you may have noticed there’s a bit of fluff in between the two teams, as you see in the Doves’ comics…<br>
…so that makes this a nice setup for a TV show.<br>
Here’s one of my favorite jokes (from the same comic as last week), not sure if I’ve ever done one myself before…<br>
Ravens: “Is this a problem, or do we not seem to need each other?”<br>
</p>
<p>Doves: “Hmph, yeah, you know, sometimes this is just a bunch of crazy people fighting the wrong battles, getting hurt and killed… like… every human needs a little bad luck, you know?</p>
