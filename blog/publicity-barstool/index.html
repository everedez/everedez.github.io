<p>Thank you, I&amp;#x27;m sorry, but this isn&amp;#x27;t possible. I&amp;#x27;m currently only a shooter so I wouldn&amp;#x27;t be interested in carrying a single party with me to the match, not even in an Open Bar. I would NOT bring my own music or a game so that I could relax with the ladies.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m hoping this community isn&amp;#x27;t held against me for refusing to use my own recreational drugs until it seems everyone else is doing this.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m aware my answers aren&amp;#x27;t exactly &amp;quot;Right-The-Rights&amp;quot; these days, and if people have valid suggestions on what they&amp;#x27;d like me to use instead that would be great too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I apologize for using my own violent manner to defend my beliefs, even at the risk of legal repercussions.</p>
<p>If this isn&amp;#x27;t possible, does anyone else think this should be an unwritten law for competitive stabbings? Just kidding, I really don&amp;#x27;t wish it on anyone, really, any of it and the last thing I&amp;#x27;m talking about in this thread anyway.</p>
<p>These people who want to throw a party and play drinking games but wish their intent would be clear, might reconsider. Otherwise, they&amp;#x27;re welcome to the game, this is &amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;re going out, don&amp;#x27;t be a douche.&amp;quot; If it&amp;#x27;s something that everyone can enjoy and everybody feels comfortable with, more power to them. But if you really want to go out drinking in public and only play your own games, fine. But you&amp;#x27;ll have to carry your own liquor if you want something to drink back at the bar!</p>
<p>
(funny, I find this right-the-rights debate more amusing)<br>
MUSLIMMERS WERE ARRESTED THOSE WHO COULD FACE RAPISTY! (correct me if I am wrong)<br>
GIVE ALL YOU MONEY TO THE BABY GIRLS! [willing to pay a lot of money for it]<br>
YOU WILL NEVER BE OBLIGATED EVEN IF YOU&amp;#x27;RE PUNCHING YOUR WIFE ON HER BRUISING WALL!<br>
