<h1>Septa Trolley Modernization</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Essen Factory began demolition of its former factory hall in August 2016, with further demolition scheduled to begin in December 2018. The new parkway station site has been selected, with a new passenger station to be built at the southwest end of the new platform area, a taxi access and departure area, sidewalks and bike racks near the bus stop, bicycle parking facilities for walkers and cyclists, bike showers and open-air storage for bikes, a larger control center and indoor car parking. An access ramp to the new building is planned to run along the lower platform level towards the middle of the upper platform level, adjacent to the other taxi access. The new passenger station on the station site also has a connection ramp from the main part of platform 2 to station level, and an elevator from the station to the waiting lounge.</p>
<p>Previous efforts in making the new station more attractive to the public, such as a lighting system, improved lighting by the lighted construction zones and a concert stage would require more capital. Therefore, as part of its future modernization project the Essen Factory will now operate the Mavra Wiese station since the Essen Transit was sold to a national company with a long term stay of nearly six years. To cover the costs the Essen Factory is in the process of selling its collection of old vehicles, mainly the heavy vehicles and taxis, and in turn selling its old lighting system.</p>
<h2>City Hall</h2>
<p>The Essen Factory is the location of the City Hall of Essen on the western side of the Hallen, which will gradually get its own station on the S-Bahn (vertical) and S6 lines. A new section of stairs between the city hall and the administrative office are currently being built which allows the administrative office to move with it from platform 1 to the lower section of platform 2 next to it. There will also be a new multi-story stairway to allow entrance to the hallen of the administrative offices above which lead to the Hallen stairs.</p>
<p>Parking lots</p>
<p>The Essen Factory has 27 parking lots for its freight vehicles. Three lots between the Essen Ferry Terminal and the station have been converted into lots for heavy commercial vehicles. The remaining ones all have been converted to parking lots for light commercial vehicles, such as buses and taxis.</p>
