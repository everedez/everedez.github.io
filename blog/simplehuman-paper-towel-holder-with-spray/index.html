<h1>Simplehuman Paper Towel Holder With Spray</h1>
<p>We have found a great way to bring together items that can belong to more than one person! This Towel Holder with Spray includes two of our smaller paper towels. The smaller paper towels are available in a variety of sizes and colors. The large towel can be used for drying clothes while the small towel has extra large enough to hold a lot of books. And we have thrown in a red and white spray that will make the entire towel and paper towel statement. Let’s get to it!</p>
<p>Some of you might not know this, but many people over the time have discovered the benefits of a plain paper towel towel. After all, they come in a wide variety of styles, colors, and other factors that make them very important. Many people use them to store glasses in an unpretentious manner, and a multitude of people might use the paper towel for cleaning their dishes. I’ve been using them not only because they are so convenient, but also because I couldn’t come up with any better way to decorate my home.</p>
<p>For example, you can dress up a plain paper towel towel in a stylish manner by putting a label on it. Or, rather than doing it the traditional way just by letting a beautiful label hang from the top, this task can be done simply as a small letter saying “POTATO POODLE” that looks very unique and stands out from the rest. The blue and white paper also adds a pleasant element that can make any room of the house a festive setting. The paper towel can also be used to make a personalized invitation for any event.</p>
<p>Why might you want to use these fine paper towel towels around the house? They are readily available and in very small sizes. So it is easy to use them as more or less any object that you need.</p>
