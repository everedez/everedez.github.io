<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Based on their general appearance and location, cities were once categorized into urban, suburban, and rural. Since then, many cities have undergone many changes. The metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Buffalo, and Dallas now have dozens of daily flights to international airports. Meanwhile, hundreds of daily flights to airports outside large urban metropolitan areas have been built.</p>
<p>All of this activity poses a large amount of economic pressure on the airports and taxi companies.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the amount of stops and transfers caused by these transfers, airport taxi providers have formed “Lackawanna Group” to co-develop a “Taxi Larger Carrier” offering transfers from and to each of four “E’s”.</p>
<p>The points of these E’s are to reduce congestion at taxi lot sites, improve the customer experience, improve the efficiency of airport operations, and reduce the cost for the entire travel experience.</p>
<p>What is a taxi Larger Carrier (TLC)?</p>
<p>TLC makes airport transfers more efficient, decreases the time before the vehicle is able to board, and reduces the time for the customer to travel.</p>
<p>TLC has four E’s: Exterior, Interior E’s, Dedicated Carriers, and Flexible Trucks. With these points, all other points must be purchased individually.</p>
<p>The point of the First E’ is the removal of long waits times by saving more than 1.7 minutes at the airport.</p>
<p>TLC is operated by:</p>
<h2>Empire Taxi Service, Inc. (ED)</h2>
<h3>Movia Services, Inc. (MOV)</h3>
<p>In addition to TLC, there are private transportation companies selling the TLC point and TLC Fare Offerings, among other E’s.</p>
<p>Just as many E’s are separated into different car model types (e.g. E’s are divided between Sedans, SUVs, and vans.), each car model type has its own special designations and pricing.</p>
