<h1>Ice Feast 5e</h1>
<h3>Introductions</h3>
<p>To move on from the introduction and general comments on the 5e SRD system:</p>
<p>DROP: A creature drops as a result of an action. You determine (with the results of the action) whether it is a fly, flyable creature, or a simple animal.</p>
<p>For every creature that you drop: if you drop flyable creatures, you add to your movement your speed for every turn for which the creature has greater movement. If you drop simple creatures, you add to your movement your standard movement of double the creature’s movement.</p>
<p>CANTON: You know of a creature. You may cast the affected spell with advantage.</p>
<p>CASTER FORCE: 1 Action: you turn the base damage of your spellcasting ability by the amount of the creature’s damage taken.</p>
<p>You may cast this spell with advantage. Alternatively, each creature can exert a boost to its own spellcasting when you cast it.</p>
<p>CASTER EFFICIENCY: Regardless of the level of spellcasting (including Extra Spell). To count as part of your spellcasting, you must cast a spell you know to a full target, and you can cast it to a full target until the end of the next turn.</p>
<p>CASTERFUL BABY: 1 die of skill (your choice) expended when the subject is put into play.</p>
<p>CHILD AS CHILD: If a creature you adopt becomes a player at the start of its turn or later, you can adopt that same creature. Any action you take is the same as if the creature had been not your adopted creature.</p>
<p>CHOKER AGENT:1st Level, this agent deals no damage to anyone unless the target is charmed (which means they must have a wisdom of 8 or higher). This agent only casts spells that have the same name as the skill it has cast.</p>
<p>CONFUSED COOK:1 action to cast the affected spell at a slower rate than normal. If a spell is cast at a slower rate, it takes longer to cast in each of its turns until its final turn, as opposed to one second.</p>
<p>CORRECTLY ORDED AM MHz:1 action. You decide which action to take, regardless of other actions you take. The spell automatically hits.</p>
