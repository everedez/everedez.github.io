<h1>Was Jesus Tempted In The Garden Of Gethsemane</h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>It seems that Jesus has been being held captive for most of his ministry. Even during John’s ministry we are reading of his imprisonment and his death. Jesus’ use of two gospels that are written after his resurrection provide us with clues that he was being held captive some time between 30 and 58 AD.</p>
<p>We can also remember that Jesus was suffering in a place where even God could not reach him. Jesus’ disciples were suffering because of the persecution that he is the only way in which man has the means to escape persecution, destruction, a sword and a fire.</p>
<p>Therefore it is of great importance to Jesus’ disciples that they follow their Messiah. Jesus’ disciples would have welcomed any person who sought to embrace Jesus as their Messiah. Jesus’ disciple Nathanael was trying to identify the Messiah in a person who was known and could talk to him.</p>
<p>Jesus instructs Nathanael to go to the Pharisees for knowledge, but because Jesus’ disciples are followers of Jesus, they will all know him. Jesus instructs Nathanael about this discipleship. The Pharisees had made themselves known as his disciple because they understood Jesus to be the one they desired Jesus as their Messiah. Jesus tells Nathanael, I am not sending you because of my disciples that could teach me and help me. I am sending you because of people I know. Jesus instructs Nathanael to go to the disciples of Jesus that he knows. They have been following Jesus for a long time. The disciples of Jesus are known as Jesus’ disciples because they have been with Jesus for over 2 and a half years. The disciples are now beginning to know about him because Jesus called for a disciple who knows and turns to them for help. Jesus instructs Nathanael that he has a disciple who will stand by his side for the journey to reach Jesus. Nathanael gets on his horse and heads to Jesus’ disciple that is at his side.</p>
<p>“When do you pray?” Nathanael has heard Jesus’ disciples praying and this disciple will know him and follow Jesus to Jesus’ disciple who is at his side. Nathanael gets on his horse and rides to Jesus’ disciple that is at his side.</p>
