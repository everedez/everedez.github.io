<h1>Gavin Spitzner Obituary</h1>

<p>&amp;quot;Gavin Spitzner passed away at the age of 58 on January 24th, 2019. He was born in Falfurrias, Texas, on April 25th, 1960. Gavin is a very quiet and shy person and loved his family and most of all his Savior Jesus. Gavin was the first member of his family to have any success during high school and became the youngest member to graduate from UT. Gavin was graduated from UT in 1985 with a biology major, married to his sweetheart, and had six beautiful children. Gavin and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona when he was 24. Gavin was an enthusiastic, outdoorsy, natural born organizer who loved the outdoors. Gavin and his family were very active as he loved getting outside and spending time with other people. He was a self-motivated realist that had a mission to serve his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Gavin started his first church in 1985 when he was just 17 years old and was involved in it for the next 20 years. He was not a fan of high school, but his heart was not there with any expectations. He was very open minded in his whole approach to life. &amp;quot; he was known for his tenderness in his words and generous heart. He died very peacefully at home surrounded by family members.</p>
<p>Our thoughts are with his family and friends. His legacy will have God bringing down the judgment of our tribulation to our church family. Gavin enjoyed fishing as a youngster, camping in the mountains as a youngster, training, or just watching sports, (track, football, basket-ball). He is survived by his wife Carole, and their two wonderful children Spencer (sunnypagan) (Maddie&amp;#x27;s middle) Gavin and Samantha born in 2017, Austin (and Kim) (Karen&amp;#x27;s middle) Gavin born in 2012, son in law Eugene (McDixon) Gavin born in 2013, daughter in law Hope (Davidson) Gavin born in 2016, and twin dogs Scooter and Lucky (Chris) born in 1985.</p>
<h2>Remembering Gavin:</h2>
<p>&amp;quot;We love you Gavin. You are one of the best things that we can think of about our family. God was with you&amp;quot; â€“ Said Amy M.</p>
