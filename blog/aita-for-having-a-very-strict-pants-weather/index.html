<p>I thought about this, too. I recently participated in the &amp;quot;fashion&amp;quot; survey for PORNHUB, and there was a question about whether the person should wear pants or skirt more than once a week (e.g., the person who wasn’t wearing pants in the above picture: yes. A woman in their mid to late teens but not a teenager...more&amp;gt;</p>

<p>A: But that’s just why many women and girls live in the present, right? Yes, I meant to say not the future but the present. Most women and girls don’t live for some imagined future when they might have some time to dedicate to caring for themselves and looking a bit better. We’re in this world now, for better or worse. And no one ever said women had to choose between this and the future.</p>
<p>Q: Do I have to wear pants every day? Why?</p>
<p>A: If you have to wear pants every day, then what are you able to accomplish with your life? Do you have time for physical exercise and social interaction?</p>
<p>
Q: These trousers are surprisingly tiny. Where did they come from?<br>
A: Some days you might only want to wear them at the gym or at the yoga studio …<br>
Q: Are those pants the kinds that are only good for wearing on a beach or hiking in natural environments?<br>
</p>
<p>A: Not exactly. They might be good for a pool or any outdoor activity. But they’re also at home (or store) in their bigger size just for making shopping easier.</p>
<p>Q: Pants make the wearer look like she had a careless day.</p>
