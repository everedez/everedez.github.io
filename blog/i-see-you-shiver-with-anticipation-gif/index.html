<h2>Author’s Notes:</h2>
<p>I figured it’d be good to start the season off from Season 1’s cliff, and finish it off with “One Of Us Knows.” My dear readers, I’ll give you an outline of the last eighteen months without spoiling it — if you still feel the need: I got a kick out of the crazy religious man and some of the crazy religious women in the show, backstabbed a couple, and fooled my two major characters into staying friends! I suspect this is the only real break from the 90s trilogy, in that we get a kick out of getting things right. I like all seasons, because they all get better, and I like all seasons because they all get better. Season 4 gets better, for those of you who prefer horror (not the demonic half). Season 5 was probably the best season ever, and certainly worth a marathon. Season 6 just got funnier. Season 7 kicked all our asses. After that Season 8 was surprisingly decent — but it’s my favorite season so far. The awesome season finale of Supernatural, which should be on Netflix now, was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. I’m incredibly proud to be a part of the reboot! If the show is weird, I hope it ends up like this. Because nothing in life ever truly sucks until you get to spend the past 13 seasons in the confines of the Hellmouth and get a quick shot of Satan, while you hang out with, and finally live a hell of a lot longer than the next person on your team.</p>
