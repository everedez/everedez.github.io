<h1>Alec Adamson Prosper</h1>
<p>(1941) Born March 6th, in Kijev, Russia, the son of a policeman. After working in a vineyard, he was encouraged to begin an off-duty career in the army. Adamson passed the Officer candidate School and went to the army headquarters to enroll. After his second year, he joined the fighter pilots school, so he spent his time training. After they graduated, he was sent to Germany for training in flight. Adamson&amp;#x27;s training included training in a Spitfire, fighter pilot, fighter plane repairman, co-pilot, navigator, instructor, and instructor in aerial gunnery.</p>
<p>As a fighter pilot, Adamson&amp;#x27;s training included participating in operations against the Luftwaffe. During the war, he participated in a number of dog fights. During these dog fights, he would participate in both bombing raids and strafing attacks. After the war, Adamson returned to Russia where he joined the revolutionary movement. Between the ages of 20 and 50, he moved from one job to another in Moscow, looking for work. During those years, he befriended several revolutionaries and became one of the most famous revolutionaries in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>As a student in Moscow, Adamson participated in many demonstrations against the state and the autocracy. He was one of three candidates to become a leader in the Soviet youth. Once he was elected to the position, he became a loyal communist-enemy-of-the-state. After returning to Russia, Adamson began working in a wine factory, as a factory worker. Adamson later attempted to join the army but was not accepted. Instead, he joined the Communist Party, and subsequently the underground in Moscow. After going back into the wine business, Adamson went on to start a caf√©, which wasn&amp;#x27;t able to survive due to disagreements. At the beginning of the 20th Century, he worked as an executive for a branch of the national bank.</p>
<p>Adamson was always at the forefront of revolution.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1922, he was accused of being the leader of the underground organization, and he was considered to have become one of the leaders of the revolution. When it came to revising the constitution, he advocated more democratic election of the leader, and a power sharing between the nation and elected officials. During one rally, the demonstration was blocked by several organizations including the lower part of the government.</p>
