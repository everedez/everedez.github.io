In related news, Karen Matus would like you to know you can email her at<br>
mats2@musc.verdictlabs.com if you&amp;#x27;d like to testify in this case in order to save the<br>
time I would pay in keeping your testimony off the record.<br>
She also added she doesn&amp;#x27;t expect that would change.<br>

New York, NY - Karen Matus of Muscatine, Iowa says that no matter what happens<br>
to you, no matter what has happened to all of us, no matter whether it<br>
justifies the State of Iowa to lock you up again or not, whatever happens, she<br>
dismisses your testimony as nothing more than your own defense of a crime you<br>
didn&amp;#x27;t do. Even if it&amp;#x27;s murder, she explains, is different than it would be if<br>
your parents were wrongfully charged with a crime you didn&amp;#x27;t commit, and that<br>
is when a jury will decide to find you guilty not of one crime but three.<br>
</p>
<p>Basically, her description of that is:</p>
<p>
Karen Matus<br>
Muscatine, IA<br>
Deliver Letter<br>
Stephanie Darrion<br>
Karen Matus<br>
The following note is my recollection of what Karen Matus told me in my<br>
</p>
<p>office in Muscatine last week:</p>
<p>
Delivering letter<br>
Deliver letter - Karen Matus<br>
One of the most important things about your participation in this trial, was the<br>
fact that you have already given testimony in court that you might be honest and<br>
true and that we all realize that you probably were not. Your testimony might<br>
also be self-serving to protect yourself, as well as others.<br>
One thing I&amp;#x27;m watching with great interest is the testimony you will be given<br>
that you now say is not true. Your testimony was truthful from what I can see<br>
from reading it now when you read it your third time. So who are you now saying<br>
I don&amp;#x27;t quote you?<br>
