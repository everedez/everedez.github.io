<h1>When His Eyes Opened Chapter 2783</h1>
<p>
He looked at me.<br>
&amp;quot;Well... did I do well?&amp;quot; He asked, his voice clearly justifiably curious in contrast to his awkwardness.<br>
I was flustered, having just managed to sound girly and not really, but it didn&amp;#x27;t matter. &amp;quot;Really well.&amp;quot;<br>
He nodded and sat on the tailgate.<br>
&amp;quot;So... you see those trees?&amp;quot;<br>
I nodded as though I&amp;#x27;d just remembered something.<br>
&amp;quot;Yes?&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>&amp;quot;This is not the way we&amp;#x27;re going, but I&amp;#x27;ve been thinking about it. This way won&amp;#x27;t have any of them obstructing our view.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>He tried not to sound too amused. His insubstantial body was barely more than a blip on the carpet of a much larger boy as I stared at him with my heart in my throat. He knew I was sorry. I was feeling awful. I&amp;#x27;d never told him the truth of it. I&amp;#x27;d just shoved it behind my back. Over time, I&amp;#x27;d found my inability to speak about it meant I wasn&amp;#x27;t hiding it from him, and yet again, he found this out. He thought that I might be faking an inability to speak on the assumption that if anyone ever found out the true facts of his encounter with the boy in the sky that he&amp;#x27;d be scarred as well. That was the pattern with him. For some unkind time, his curiosity had managed to run riot with a genuine interest in the little creatures who only he had affection for. Then eventually, he&amp;#x27;d realised that the real reason was that I couldn&amp;#x27;t talk about the memories I was concealing in the great wooden box of memories. That this is a world I couldn&amp;#x27;t reach out to in my panic, because of the limitations of reality, because I was ashamed of it all.</p>
<p>The little boy had told him this in the garden of his great apartment home, beneath a beautiful tree in a beautiful park.</p>
<p>
He&amp;#x27;d spoken just as I&amp;#x27;d said.<br>
He&amp;#x27;d spoken with wisdom and a touch of pride.<br>
&amp;quot;And what would you like me to tell you before we go again?&amp;quot;<br>
I grinned at him while the memory of that innocent question rang through the earth in my heart.<br>
</p>
