<h3>San Diego</h3>
<p>Sears, Roebuck is a fairly expensive brand to be part of the commercial real estate game. Even still, its value and amenity are the main draws for investors, real estate brokers, and homebuyers. The place gets plenty of business from people outside of the area looking for cheaper land, and the neighborhood of Santee is littered with retail and institutional spaces that generally let up its property values in exchange for better rent control, plus a stable of tenants for the community amenities.</p>
<p>In Seattle, it is not uncommon for developers to find ways to not get under budget by increasing rents. There is a bunch of space on Capitol Hill near the Quay. Again, it’s a location with enough potential for growth but it’s not dense enough to carry high rent. It’s not the kind of place to be in. With downtown Seattle rates at the high end of what the region is used to seeing, and the market for most downtown homes to still be well under the market rate, I’d tend to think that we’re bound to see rents go up eventually.</p>
<p>And then it would mean that we’ve given up on commercial real estate. That would be a sad loss, to be sure, but it would mean a lot more growth. In fact, I’d worry more about the housing market here if we’d stuck with business all the way through. It used to be that Seattle was a place where commercial real estate was meant to be. New buildings came in, old buildings left. It was a place where the market could look north and look south, and for a while, it wasn’t dominated by the rich and famous. It was a place where the rich and famous went to work. That’s a place we wouldn’t have to change a damn thing.</p>
