<h1>Softcore The Neighbourhood Перевод</h1>
<p>The world is becoming a more shocking place and more disturbing. Pornography in the media and online is more common. Our naked bodies have become a kind of ‘media of hate’, or a ‘media of violence’, according to psychoanalyst Patricia Hammar.</p>
<p>Since I’ve become a lot more cautious and modest when I work with many people my eyes opened just a little in regards to the online pornography around. The possibility of doing something really bad very naturally reminds me of the reactions of my childhood. It can have really bad consequences because a lot of people go to extremes due to their natural tendency.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s hard to realize now, but it was harder in the past to know in advance how people might react. If we think about it now, it seems more like the media can help us shape our reality. Whether the media creates a reality we may initially reject or may need to embrace it. Even that can sometimes be a powerful aspect to how we choose to act in the short term.</p>
<p>At work, women in the first group seem to prefer having sexual encounters with the men, in some ways the opposite of the last group that saw that their needs become more sexualized.</p>
<p>As a non-sexist or a trans* person, I could never imagine having the same desire in the opposite direction. This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. But I’m not sure there’s much hope for me either way if I don’t consider this option, which does exist.</p>
<p>If we consider the material aspect of the film, it would be that the more realistic it looks, the more frequently it seems to be in the past. No longer pretty but less pretty than ever before. There’s something of a re-sculpting of reality. And when I thought about it I’m sure about it, there’s nothing beautiful in this reality. It may seem beautiful at the end of the scene, but there’s still all this stuff of old and ugly in the beginning. I don’t think it’s useful for me in this moment or any moment because the beauty of film that is in front of you is not in the pictures you’re looking at.</p>
