<h1>2023 Ford Thunderbird Concept</h1>
<p>In January of 2016, Detroit&amp;#x27;s American Racing Company opened the doors to its first &amp;quot;Corvette Fast Build&amp;quot; factory shop. After some initial problems with the assembly line and a lack of materials for them to build the vehicles, founder Donald Lebant decided that his first priority in manufacturing his new American design was &amp;quot;to get on their 2.5-liter turbo Mustang.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The American &amp;quot;Corvette Fast Build&amp;quot; facility, which has since been upgraded and is now fully operational, was one of the first to produce a commercial Corvette with factory sales to be completed in Detroit. These &amp;quot;Fast Build&amp;quot; plants employ about 600 high-tech mechanics to build the beautiful American cars.</p>
<p>As a follow up to the success of its American &amp;quot;Corvette Fast Build&amp;quot; factories, Donald Lebant again opened the factory in late 2017 and is planning to build a new &amp;quot;Corvette&amp;quot; factory in Bowling Green, MI.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s also planned to build in Bowling Green, OK. Detroit is in Bowling Green.</p>
<p>Rumors and speculations seem to indicate that the factory will be built on a larger chassis and carry on through to a production model in 2018 with the factory name being the &amp;quot;Corvette Super Sports&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>All too-sporting streetcars, rare luxury sport utility vehicles and the best Italian supercars, this car is almost certain to receive one of these levels of excellence on this website.</p>
<p>It is absolutely an incredible machine - a gift! One with many qualities which we simply cannot describe or reiterate here. This is certainly not a car which has been created with the sole purpose of making a profit for anyone. This is a rare case of a car which is already appreciated widely throughout the world. It is a true &amp;quot;art car&amp;quot;. It is a car that has been built as if it was meant to be custom built to the owner&amp;#x27;s specifications and needs, to meet his desires. Certainly this car will not please everyone. Just consider that this is a custom car. There will be many detractors when this turns into a production model. Then, it might just be a collector&amp;#x27;s item. But, do not let that worry you.</p>
<p>All this aside, this is an off-road vehicle!</p>
