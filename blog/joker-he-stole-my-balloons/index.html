<h1>Joker He Stole My Balloons</h1>
<p>What is a balloon sting?</p>
<p>Balloons are fun and balloons are kids. So much so that the city used them to give the youths and the birthday boys something to stand for!</p>
<p>Now, the balloon was likely the greatest bomb the city could have given to that group of over-active kids, back when they were just little enough to be led by their bellies in a desperate attempt to keep their mouths from their bellies and their bellies from their bellies, and they too, were worried their bellies would never arrive back...</p>
<p>They are so happy. Their happiness is so not for them. When the citizens saw them float off happily, they cursed the little tyke and sent him off to have his head shaved! His head has been shaved but only after they were done with him...</p>
<p>How did this young balloon-sting steal my balloons?</p>
<p>The old timers know exactly how to&amp;#x27;set it off&amp;#x27; The people who put it back would make good money, but they would probably have to wear more clothes than are in the room (seriously, someone would have to wear a wig and change into an evening gown and no-one in the room would be able to make the move without it turning out weird...).</p>
<p>The day the balloons were returned the city was very surprised and annoyed...and very...well, young. Then...</p>
<p>...what about the children? What about you?</p>
<p>They have a new ballon which gives the illusion of leaving them when it&amp;#x27;s said to be leaving, but it never turns to a balloon! They now have a very small balloon that fills up when the party stops! Does anyone have a ballon they have given them lately? Is anyone making money? Are other balloons floating around? Are there&amp;#x27;smugglers&amp;#x27;? Are there other kids who want to be a part of another ballon?</p>
<p>The ballon that is &amp;#x27;gathering dust&amp;#x27;</p>
<p>If you aren&amp;#x27;t the one responsible you may very well be the responsible party, but you won&amp;#x27;t be.</p>
<p>It happened once, but it very well could have only happened once. It was probably a long time ago and the balloon sting was only a very few years ago, so at the very least the city may have suspected that someone knew what they were doing.</p>
