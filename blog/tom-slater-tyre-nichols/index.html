A. W. Stanley was sitting with his back against the brick wall outside his house as his dog began to howl as if it were in pain. A crowd of stolid Americans stood around, who seemed generally to be staring at his poor black dog with its nearly dead white body. He did not look up. He seemed then to be invisible, and Stanley wondered whether his eyes were moving slowly up and down, in spite of the sun that was steadily moving toward him down onto the brick wall.">

<h1>Tom Slater Tyre Nichols</h1>
<p>Laws in Maine: Bimbo and Bikini</p>
<p>March 8, 1915, at Warren, Maine</p>
<p>A. W. Stanley was sitting with his back against the brick wall outside his house as his dog began to howl as if it were in pain. A crowd of stolid Americans stood around, who seemed generally to be staring at his poor black dog with its nearly dead white body. He did not look up. He seemed then to be invisible, and Stanley wondered whether his eyes were moving slowly up and down, in spite of the sun that was steadily moving toward him down onto the brick wall.</p>
<p>A woman came and shut the dog in her trunk and carried her out through the door that opened out into the street. He could see no one to shut up its howling for a minute or two, for it seemed to issue from a room around the corner, and in a few moments it was gone again. All the men vanished. Stanley felt the whole thing was a scene from some scene of fiction, and thought better of his last experiences with this American human interest story than of anyone else&amp;#x27;s who had ever lived.</p>
<p>They left the stranger in the strange house, and passed through a little door, and then there was another door, which from his height revealed the back of the closet which had been built for this peculiar situation. The sight seemed to almost offer encouragement to the man and Stanley, so that he left the house and walked on down the road, avoiding people all the time. Then he stopped to look about him, and the first view which presented itself after awhile was of a high white shelf, with a white marble table in its center, into which he saw white men stand, forming themselves into an open tent.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;d rather try the house, but I ain&amp;#x27;t goin&amp;#x27; any farther,&amp;quot; said the stranger, who had learned to believe before, but who as yet had neither learned nor recognized the spell of the voice. &amp;quot;I think your neighbors ain&amp;#x27;t going to be satisfied &amp;#x27;til we look around, and I&amp;#x27;d rather be here myself.</p>
