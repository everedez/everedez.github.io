<h1>Steven Rawlins Pickerington</h1>
<p>
The 1877 winner was a 2nd<br>
Runner-up and one of the top classes of the event. They were brothers<br>
William and Edwin Rawlins from Exeter, Devon. In the same month it<br>
was their first real victory. William was the son of William Rawlins.<br>
He was a captain&amp;#x27;s officer in the 3rd Light Dragoons.<br>
They were considered as one of the best specimens of the 1877 champion,<br>
and it is almost impossible to find a better illustration of their<br>
career than this achievement. By dint of hard work, careful selection<br>
and due diligence, by mere chance they were selected at the lottery of<br>
the 1884 first class. For the first time the Rawlins beat the old favourite<br>
Rob Mitchell, who had won Â£200 in the first class in 1865. Edward is<br>
a direct descendant of John Rawlins of Exmouth.<br>
But the Rawlins brothers were not forgotten in the championship. Soon<br>
after their victory at Dartford, the same car-racing interests put<br>
forward James Lawrence as a driver. He was the brother of Edwin&amp;#x27;s<br>
cousin Thomas Lawrence, who was an active member of a campaigning group<br>
called &amp;quot;Cockney Irregulars&amp;quot;. He was the first to secure a car in<br>
a British championship, and the most successful British champion of<br>
the period, until the victory of J.J.T.K. Gilmour of Brooklands in<br>
the 1903 Inter-Cab. Over this time the Lawrence brothers won 20<br>
capitals. They ran good cars. In 1879 Edwin ran a Bresladian car,<br>
and in 1885 they again ran a Caroeo car. In 1896 and 1897, they both<br>
bought motor cars, and the combination led to their long and well<br>
earned reputed supremacy in the car world. On more than one occasion<br>
two brothers (W.S and E.W) used to join forces to drive one rival<br>
to ruin, which they always came out of. It was observed that, &amp;quot;it was<br>
not wise to lose a race,&amp;quot; and William in this instance won the first<br>
race in the C.C.C. Cup.<br>
In 1857, Edwin Rawlins bought an unclassified car at Abbotsford,<br>
on the Lincolnshire-Oxfordshire line.<br>
