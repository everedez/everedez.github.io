</p>
<p>About This Page: The New Grand River is a meandering road in northern Minnesota, approximately 50 miles (80 kms) from La Crosse and 80 miles (130 kms) from Kaladar. A road through history with a romantic old world charm, it&amp;#x27;s a spectacular setting for fishing, camping, and outdoor adventures on Grand River. The narrow &amp;quot;Path of the King&amp;quot; that the Grand River is called, is significant due to the fact that it was the route traveled by King Arthur and a giant wooden fence line still stands to this day. The land is large and flat, so the width of the meandering path made for good fish. There are plenty of islands at the ford that allow you to fish across, and the boats allow you to fish in for several hours. The Big Spring is a big campground and long way from shore. Don&amp;#x27;t miss the following spots, especially Grand Rapids Isle!</p>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Since 1927, the first Minnesota Vikings played the University of Minnesota in Crookston, Minnesota. While attending the school, John Heisman served in the U.S. House, as well as in the U.S. Congress. However, it was also through his presence at Crookston that John is best remembered in football. The last game that the Vikings played was in 1931, and the Vikings&amp;#x27; last victory came at the end of the 1912 season.</p>
<p>The Vikings, as well as the University of Minnesota, are the only school in Minnesota that the university has not relocated. The idea of the university moving to Crookston in 1928 is even younger in reality, as the university was founded in 1872 by German immigrant Herman Luehrs. Luehrs is so influential that the university is often referred to as the &amp;quot;Luehrs School.&amp;quot; The football game between Luehrs and Crookston&amp;#x27;s first football coach Henry Root was played for the first official NCAA game in the 21st century which was held on September 11, 2014.</p>
