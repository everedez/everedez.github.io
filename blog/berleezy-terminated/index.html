<h1>Berleezy Terminated</h1>
<p>Welcome to a New Year and a new season of E3. Season 8 already seems to be in the early stages with lots of new partners and experiences coming in. Perhaps this means that it won’t be as long as last time out. That is a big open question I’ll leave to the public to see. But here are the things we know so far for our 2016 Preview that can’t be missed.</p>
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has stepped back from big announcements this time around from the video game reveal stage and back to the meat of the year opening year of this new season. The video game reveal is still very much centered around the open beta/pre-release of the Fallout franchise but Bethesda has injected even more importance onto the Fallout 3 game. We are no longer going to have the same kind of event for those two games. No talk about multiplayer first-person shooters and longwinded (“take it away”) talk about how the game will be modifiable. They have given the game a focus on quality and will not throw tons of stuff at everyone that isn’t required for our liking. The focus is clearly on what really sets this new Fallout 3 game apart from the Bethesda games so far. It is not a Red Dead clone. Well there will be no Red Dead. Oh okay then. The company feels that it is a ‘good’ video game but as such will not be trying to sell you a video game you won’t like. It is then going to be our guest that wants to buy it (or an interesting piece of DLC). Again we will see this game come first out of all the games in November and then we will see what happens with multiplayer first-person shooter parts and how exactly the open beta is to ‘fight’ those feelings.</p>
<p>Fallout: New Vegas is the first video game show series to return to doing a bit of live play for a couple days every week. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the 1,5 weeks after the Xbox 360 exclusive version of the game is out will be a success. I’ll be interested to see how many people can actually make it out to see the game.</p>
<p>The 1st live show is to be held in front of a live audience.</p>
