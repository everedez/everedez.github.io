<h1>Niagara Vs Canisius Prediction</h1>
<p>The Niagara Battle has been well known as one of the most important events in men’s Volleyball throughout the country. The ITA has been the country’s best conference with a perfect record at the Bracket Final since 2006, and they are going to be one of the main reasons why the ITA will be able to regain their pride in 2008 season. Niagara will be the number one seed this year.</p>
<p>What is the canisius Predicted winners? Well, the ITA has always been considered the best overall volleyball conference with the notable effect that the Final Four teams were always the favorites in every season.</p>
<p>But that was only the case in years before they transformed the talent in the system and put the likes of UCLA, UCLA-USCA and others on their way to world-class Volleyball talent throughout the country. But by “Transform”, we really mean the new-age arrival of everyone from players from different parts of the world, coming into the game with different characteristics.</p>
<p>This year, with the arrival of 8 new teams in the league, a different talent pool has welcomed all of the top eight teams and are now taking their spot in the Final Four.</p>
<p>However, the good thing is that this batch of newcomers have the strength to adapt as they prove their worth and claim their place in the finals, which is already going to be a hard task.</p>
<p>
Where<br>
6/11 – Vanderbilt Invitational<br>
6/12 – Boston Latin Olympics<br>
7/11 – Burlington County Memorial Cup<br>
7/12 – Massachusetts State University Fair<br>
7/13 – Golden Gloves (Athens, GA)<br>
7/20 – Georgetown Invitational<br>
7/22 – Raleigh Invitational<br>
7/25 – Maine Challenge<br>
8/1 – Erie Invitational<br>
</p>
<p>The Invitational is a tough one but the schools aren’t expected to be significantly different from the ones they played in 2006 and what is more will be the only game they will play. The only big changes are the return of some stars (Roz Berrigan and Seth Boman back in the season), the home field advantage so they will get more playing time, and the return of both players to UNC Glynco.</p>
<p>So what will the ‘Shoes of Syracuse’ look like?</p>
