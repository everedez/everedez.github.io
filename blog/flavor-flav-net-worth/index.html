<h1>Flavor Flav Net Worth</h1>
<p>Flavor Flav, real name of Jim Pagano, is an actor, singer, voice actor, record producer, and record executive/producer. He rose to prominence as the leader of the 1980s West Texas punk rock collective known as the Razor and Foreskin Band and later operated as a recording artist. He also held an executive production position with other record labels but after a decade of suffering with AIDS, Flav officially renounced his claim to mortality.</p>
<p>Flavor Flav had been an active performer since the early 1980s and later turned his attention to acting. He began recording music as a way to pay tribute to his deceased father in 1990, which turned into a vocal format in 1993. Flav released his first major-label recording, Where Are You, in February of 1996. He became a major-label recording artist in 1998, releasing his last commercial recording in 2009 on Flamin&amp;#x27; Groovies, whose production credits include songs by Faith Hill, Pink, Boyz II Men, the Offspring, Weezer and many others. Flav also directed the video for his 1997 number-one best-of debut album, The Great American Main Event. Flav was married to singer/songwriter Jessica Hart before their 2012 split.</p>

<p>Early life and career</p>
<p>Born in Clinton, Arkansas, in 1966, Flav got into singing as a child and grew up wanting to sing professionally. Because he couldn&amp;#x27;t sing at the time, Flav worked as a laborer. He saw a singing contest in which local singers, and one of his friends, helped him find a piano and a microphone. Flav came up with the name &amp;#x27;Jim Pagano&amp;#x27; when he applied on the basis of his first initial (Pago). Pagano is a shortened form of Pagano, and Flav sometimes calls himself Jim Pagano without the &amp;#x27;f-ing&amp;#x27;. After studying business at the University of Central Arkansas (Pago in 1989) and then at the University of Minnesota, he established a recording studio with his business partner Keith Edwards in Poca, Arkansas, but his mother was a nonbeliever, so the business needed to be closed when his father passed away.</p>
<p>Upon being widowed, Flav lost his music career, his business partners and most of his friends in Arkansas, which happened to be where his father was from.</p>
