CHICAGO (MarketWatch) --
Stocks were lower in the latest CHICAGO TRIANGLEMAN trading session after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he&amp;#x27;ll donate the entirety of the Model S&amp;#x27;s production in exchange for a $10 million loan. It&amp;#x27;s not clear whether Musk will take a similar approach as Elon says he&amp;#x27;ll get a $20 million loan from Jefferies Holdings Inc.">

CHICAGO (MarketWatch) --<br>

<p>Stocks were lower in the latest CHICAGO TRIANGLEMAN trading session after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he&amp;#x27;ll donate the entirety of the Model S&amp;#x27;s production in exchange for a $10 million loan. It&amp;#x27;s not clear whether Musk will take a similar approach as Elon says he&amp;#x27;ll get a $20 million loan from Jefferies Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>For comparison, Musk&amp;#x27;s CEO SpaceX is actually returning a $20 million loan with the promise to make him a part owner in a Tesla. The deal is subject to a number of conditions including the end of Musk&amp;#x27;s federal contract with NASA.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the Los Angeles-based car maker signed a $15 million loan agreement with Tesla, earning the electric carmaker a $5 million bridge loan. The BMW Group is also making a $10 million loan on behalf of the struggling marque company.</p>
<p>Tesla expects to deliver 1.4 million Model S cars this year with a 2.2 million production run. General Motors is also in the mix at a $15 million loan. The loan from BMW, Tesla&amp;#x27;s loan from J.P. Morgan Chase and JPMorgan&amp;#x27;s loan from Ford Motor is to be repaid in two years and at the same rate of 15% annual return.</p>
<p>Musk was quoted in an interview with Business Insider regarding his last-minute deal with Tesla:</p>
<p>&amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s only one way for me to use the Model S and that&amp;#x27;s in production right now. It&amp;#x27;s too late at this point,&amp;quot; Musk said.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;The Model S has proven itself -- what more could ever mean?&amp;quot;</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan Chase, which is at the center of Musk&amp;#x27;s scheme with Tesla, has a loan agreement to return to Tesla. The company is returning a $10 million loan with a 50-50 financing rate of return for Musk and then paying back in a 20-year cycle.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;This transaction further broadens the range of credit products available to the Company,&amp;quot; J.</p>
