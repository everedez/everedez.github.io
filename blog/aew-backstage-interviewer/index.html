<h1>Aew Backstage Interviewer</h1>
<p>It has taken me months to get around to doing this blog, but by far, I am the most talented person to have ever climbed the mountain on this mountaineering expedition. Sure, I am a very experienced climber by any standards. I climbed all the mountain ranges of Yosemite Valley in my life. However, I love this mountain. I love my wife, and my family. I like being outside, and being close to nature.</p>
<p>I have climbed the North Ridge of the El Capitan for a number of times, before, during and after my El Dorado trip. I have hiked the north face of Mount McKinley. I have hiked at least 15 ascents at Crater Lake, and in the past my wife and I have hiked at The Dalles, and Mount Mazama. I have also done the entire El Cap and North Sierras. I have been blessed with 15 summit finishes on El Cap. And, I have climbed all 37 of the world’s tallest mountains on all of the same days in a single year. I have been in all 100 of the sport climbing regions in North America; I have done all the 50 foot summits.</p>
<p>I tell the story a lot because I have always loved climbing. There have been countless times within my outdoor career that I have taken a huge risk in my attempt at climbing, because I loved that moment. I’ve been on skis and tetherball, and I’ve been in the rock garden and some of my high altitude hikes.</p>
<p>There was a time I was being fed very suspicious of my climbing partner for some unknown reason. He was “accidentally” unroped; that was a very odd situation. But the worst was getting up at 3:00pm, and then leaving my wife alone to drive all night to get to work. I almost always stay within a two mile radius of my wife to be safe. Even if you had your alarm clock set for 4:00 am, you’d still have to stop just long enough for a good night rest to wake up in time for work. At least, that’s how it has been for two decades.</p>
<p>I’ve never had any physical scars. I have never lost a leg. I have not been seriously injured in my life of climbing. I am 100% physically fit.</p>
