<h1>Mare Lamentorum</h1>
<p>The names of the Roman holiday were originally Camporeana, born in 1640 as a ceremony of consecration for all the Roman emperors before they were crowned, but they became so popular they became a full-fledged holiday in Latin America in the sixteenth century, and the holiday lasted until the 1960s, when it was replaced by the processions of the Diagorasse.  In Mexico a procession honoring it was one of many done to commemorate all Emperors.  The most elaborate processions were organized by the Papal legate, Papadis, whose imperial duties involved controlling the Roman Catholic Church&amp;#x27;s claims, making and enforcing holy customs, making peace, administering justice, and awarding and recalling benefactors.  He also organized processions where the processions of emperors were celebrated.</p>
<p>The holiday was revived in 1715 in honor of Theodosius II by Bishop Benedicto de las Ã“rdenes, the first Papal legate to do so, but Rome was displeased. In 1768 Pope Clement XIII revived the Roman Empire with a celebration of the Dii geschi, a procession that lasted two days.</p>
