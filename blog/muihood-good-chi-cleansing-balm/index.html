<h1>Muihood Good Chi Cleansing Balm</h1>
<p>I’m starting this summer off with a new fragrance by Maia Vergara. This MUIHOOD Good Chi is a very beautiful fragrance and it’s made by Japanese luxury haute perfumer MUIHOOD. It’s the first fragrance to be made entirely in Mexico and is made from Siam’s finest chiwand and tal-chasing herbs.</p>
<p>Searingly sexy; the opening note is a sassy and peppery musk; the heart notes are a creamy raspberry balsamic; and the middle notes are a nice blend of wood almond and a deep violet. As my fingers touch your skin, these notes explode in a magical burst of wild, forbidden orange and mandarin. They curl and giggle and dance before erupting all over your body and dissipating on your clothes. It looks yummy.</p>
<p>Of the heart note, I love its power. It’s the first of the eight notes, and it’s packed with juice. The civet notes dance in waves behind the raspberry and become a point of focus in the nose, as the intense raspberry opens and thunders onto your skin. The mandarin grows larger in there and spreads itself into vibrant flashes of pink. The intense orange in there is energized into a warm, deeply acidic green. And the subtle mint is replaced with a peppermint cigar with a peppery punch, and lots of powder – mint-like. And it’s only a very light floral and lemony kick, but you really get something out of it. The mint just starts to show its importance as the scent fades and the heart notes fade into a peaceful vanilla note.</p>
<p>The next note is a long, calm caramel-black chocolate, and the third, a sophisticated, spicy and chocolatey pear. The almond adds strength and the cinnamon is a clever balance with the honey and nutmeg.</p>
<p>I like the powerful heart and the meltingly sensual middle. The core and the heart are a real delight.</p>
<p>The skin and the character notes here are both sensual and very distinctive.</p>
<p>Pinks and whites – sweet and sweet and wet. The apple with the green notes is fabulous. The faint peach and blue notes are something I’m still finding out about.</p>
