[Q&amp;amp;A] Do I have to use Bitcoin or will it be enough.
A week ago I bought some of your Dapp and started to play with it but I was wary because I had seen a lot of people using it so I started to just play and learn. Once I felt that I was really well-featured I ventured off on my own adventure with the addition of a stable of Scrypt coins.">

<p>[Q&amp;amp;A] Do I have to use Bitcoin or will it be enough.</p>
<p>A week ago I bought some of your Dapp and started to play with it but I was wary because I had seen a lot of people using it so I started to just play and learn. Once I felt that I was really well-featured I ventured off on my own adventure with the addition of a stable of Scrypt coins. I saw a lot of coins being bought and sold and I was curious so I became one of the first to buy over $20,000 worth of coins. That&amp;#x27;s where I got my stable and after using them since then I wanted to make some clear statements on why I think cryptocurrencies are going to continue to be of benefit to us.</p>
<p>And that&amp;#x27;s it.</p>
<p>I guess I should start off by sharing the list of the coins. If you think you want to invest in some coin you should look at the whitepaper and if you&amp;#x27;re just starting off then the Whitepaper is the best place.</p>
<p>1. What is Bitcoin. Crypto is a form of distributed ledger technology that stores value and records transactions. It does this by using cryptography and distributed systems.<br>
2. Why is BTC an excellent choice. Cryptocurrency has been around for over two years and has a far clearer roadmap than any other currency, giving us the opportunity to go from very basic innovation in distributed and fast payment processing to a new financial framework that benefits everyday people, who pay with a credit card.<br>
3. Why is the recent rise in price going to be significant. I don&amp;#x27;t think that Bitcoin will become a super-popular currency just like gold after it&amp;#x27;s been used for decades does. Bitcoin&amp;#x27;s price is very volatile, but after three years it has made plenty of money and with the recent surge, the world is watching and looking for cryptocurrency to be used again as the standard for money and its tokens.<br>
4. The important thing in the future looks like it will be the emergence of a banking system.<br>
