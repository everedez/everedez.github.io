<h1>Randy Houle</h1>
<p>Houle has been around a bit longer than many hockey/ice-related people tend to be listed under, but I recently interviewed him about his new-found love, and how his hockey-related passion became a new career -- as a freelance hockey writer and managing editor for Pro Hockey Talk.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, you also do some freelance NHL draft coverage here on Pro Hockey Talk.</p>
<p>Here are some questions and answers from an interview with Randy Houle.</p>
<p>PHT: Talked to you in early spring about a few things I&amp;#x27;ve been meaning to mention that I&amp;#x27;m not sure I&amp;#x27;m going to be able to say (due to the short deadline). First of all, I feel your community fits well with what I do, as you guys value what each other does better than anything else. I would say that thanks to the community is evident as well across the entire community in regards to the tone and the diversity. I feel comfortable sharing what I&amp;#x27;m up to thanks to the people I&amp;#x27;ve gotten to know through the hockey/ice community on a regular basis, so that&amp;#x27;s a good thing.</p>
<p>As for the callowness, I&amp;#x27;ve been doing a good bit of the sports talk, or, I should say, the mainstream sports talk, since I&amp;#x27;ve been in the business. I have also written some reviews of NBA basketball over the years, so I have been covering some of those guys. I&amp;#x27;m trying to get better at most types of hockey coverage as well, including the NHL Draft. I know I&amp;#x27;ll have to give it a lot of thought.</p>
<p>Randy: Thank you so much for the opportunity, PHT! It&amp;#x27;s really been an honor.</p>
<p>PHT: At the end of the NHL draft, someone asked me why the &amp;quot;midseason meltdowns&amp;quot; in the league are treated as a big deal, as if it had been a Super Bowl or even a big game. I asked my Twitter follower if he could guess what kind of hockey the league would have in store for the end of the season, and he suggested you&amp;#x27;d likely get one of:</p>
<p>&amp;quot;A mini-elimination game,&amp;quot; I thought to myself.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;ve covered a few pro hockey games before, and I have to say it&amp;#x27;s rare that you get the fan interaction that you get during a game, but I have to say, I can see that happening.</p>
