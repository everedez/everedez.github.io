<h1>Mccallie Racist Video</h1>
<p>Stories like these aren&amp;#x27;t usually published, but they are simply unbearable. By far the scariest thing is all the writers and editors who had to edit it out.</p>
<p>So now this video has been removed. In the meantime, this is the original version of the story:</p>
<p>EDITORIAL: Caught on camera: Five people filmed the grubby, racist face of Mr. Marcus McDonald. Here is how my dad is described in a document signed by McDonald. The “B” on “Bastard” was a clue the Mcdonald’s manager missed. My father died, you need to come for me he pleaded. We were one of the co-conspirators and the manager and his crew laughed in his face. We are men and women, brothers, fathers and sons who love our country, we all died to save our own necks. All involved had good intentions and some good judgement, I&amp;#x27;m just glad I was young enough for the video</p>
<h2>- James Hughes</h2>
<p>For several days, local news had been reporting that five people had been arrested in a “hate crime” case after footage taken by other strangers online went viral. In a Saturday afternoon decision, police arrested 15-year-old Devontay and 15-year-old Kenneth Reese for the prank.</p>
<p>The cops arrested the boys after police swarmed a McDonald’s in Brooklyn Park, at a time when the Trump administration was pushing harder to impose further retributive measures, in this case by instituting the death penalty for gay teens.</p>
<p>Before the arrests took place, officers sat down and watched the kids in a video interview with the local NBC affiliate. At the time of the arrests, the boys were no longer charged.</p>
<p>Many of the reporters covering the case had no idea which kid’s photo the cops took, or the nature of the offense the police had committed, or how far down the scale the video would have descended from something hateful.</p>
<p>According to the local paper, McDonald apologized directly to one reporter at the scene.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to use our picture for any personal or political exploitation. I have a beef with Mr. McDonald and what he did in me and my family. Mr. McDonald’s apology about the press and their writing job was simply ridiculous.</p>
