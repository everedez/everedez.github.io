<h1>Ryan Upchurch Lawsuits</h1>
<p>[07/17/2013]</p>
<p>[Updated 01/03/2018]</p>
<p>The latest lawsuit filed against “Will Smith in the House of Liberty ” is filed by various NFL and professional wrestling fans who are not in the military. The former “NFL Films Presents” host and current stunt double has been sued by NFL and pro wrestling fans who are not in the military who were allegedly injured during a high speed motorcycle stunt. The lawsuit comes from an unknown attorney.</p>
<p>Now that there are several former NFL Films Presents host/stunts who have filed lawsuits against will smith, the claim would seem to be that there isn’t anything in the contract at issue that would prevent Will from leaving the country. That is in contrast to plaintiff’s attorney, John Hollis, who contends ” In the legal record obtained by John, it is stated that the parties negotiated for the parties not to disclose the details of the contract”, leading to this statement: “As the contract must be acknowledged to be unenforceable, the court concludes that the only possible resolution of this matter is a writ of attachments on all stock-exchange-listed shares of NFL Films for $1.40 which are held by John (Mr. Hollis) and GSI Radio-TV, Inc.”</p>
<p>Why did Hollis say he was fighting for the WWE and would get a favorable decision in court? Speculation ranges from the fact that WWE’s refusal to pay him tens of millions of dollars is not something that will be on the lips of a WWE representative that was in the room during the negotiation. Another explanation is that WWE is unable to hide anything and that neither the media nor the general public will be able to view the contract to discover the reason that it’s being challenged. That being said, a deal is not an accomplished fact, and the likelihood of WWE allowing such negotiations to play out for the public is likely only because of the high stakes involved.</p>
<p>UPDATE: A second law firm filed a motion to dismiss the Will Smith lawsuit on the grounds that the plaintiff has not established a prima facie case due to insufficient evidence as to how the defendant’s alleged negligence and injuries occurred.</p>
