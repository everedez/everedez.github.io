<p>Why on Earth is anyone playing fantasy football?</p>
<p>The time has come, the opportunity is here, the season is about to start and we cannot leave it at the final six weeks. These are also the three most important words in the fantasy football world. If you&amp;#x27;re someone that likes to hit the waiver wire later, or you&amp;#x27;re someone that always cheats and plays off your draft picks, then these words probably come as a shock. Are you reading this? What are you doing?</p>
<p>I have a question for you.</p>
<p>Why are you reading fantasy football when you don&amp;#x27;t have to?</p>
<p>The following is a list of some of the upcoming football games (any event that does not take place during the off-season) that are worth monitoring.</p>
<p>How do you go about protecting your fantasy teams in this period of time? Is there ANYWHERE that you can find a guarantee for cheap fantasy football players against your favorite teams? Let&amp;#x27;s take a look at some of the results that have been reported.</p>
<h2>March Madness Starts!</h2>
<p>Fantasy football season is getting underway by the time you read this. Usually, fantasy football writers keep their selections small until the big fantasy football events that roll around every month or two. A lot of players will sell their picks to raise their reputation. Many leagues understand that it&amp;#x27;s tough to recover from a blowout loss (go away, go home) and kick off a season. Some fantasy football guides will stop them from selling out though so that people can play at the ready for a week or so after the final product. This is OK. If you know what you are doing on the waiver wire, then you will be in great shape. Because you are already near the top of your league in terms of points, this shouldn&amp;#x27;t come as a surprise.</p>
<p>You will notice that these results should be around 1200 pts. There will be a lull of a few weeks to give teams time to adjust. But they will notice that anyone that actually plays hard will have a great chance of winning, so don&amp;#x27;t get cocky.</p>
<p>Also notice that teams that have a lot of talent are in this league. If you&amp;#x27;re a defensive player, you may want to look into this league. Each division will have two or three teams with the highest average points per game output.</p>
