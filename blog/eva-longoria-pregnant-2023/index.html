Ana is a very young lady and the comments don&amp;#x27;t reflect this.
Let me explain and by the way this is not me.
Ana: As I am with your sister Ana.
Ana: I stand by my statement that the baby is a boy.
Ana: No.">

<h1>Eva Longoria Pregnant 2023</h1>
<p>
Today&amp;#x27;s Cover Girls is Ana Escobar, you&amp;#x27;ll never forget it!<br>
On with the show!<br>
There&amp;#x27;s a great deal of hate in the comments for Ana!<br>
Ana is a very young lady and the comments don&amp;#x27;t reflect this.<br>
Let me explain and by the way this is not me.<br>
Ana: As I am with your sister Ana.<br>
Ana: I stand by my statement that the baby is a boy.<br>
Ana: No.<br>
Ana: No. Why does it have to be?<br>
</p>
<p>To someone I hate and in that moment we realize that we do in fact hate Ana to the point that we are obsessed with nothing to do with her other than how she’s feeling.</p>
<p>We have no idea what to make of this we don’t know what to say.</p>
<p>All we know is we need to get a moment like this in our lives as hard as we can.</p>
<p>Some of us need answers from the world. Some need to be told things are not right. We need to hear about who we are and why we are here. We need to need to hear information, instead of sitting around doing nothing.</p>
<p>All we have is each other though, so I really need to tell you why you’re wrong and then ask you to forgive me for my hate.</p>
<p>
I have a theory that has been proven by facts.<br>
The theory I will show you is that that all of you are complete packages.<br>
You all on the same level.<br>
And no wonder.<br>
When we start this show you’re thinking of getting on board.<br>
</p>
<p>We are all new arrivals here from around the globe. It is not clear how much of what we will find is simply new, or new that you’re trying or why this is your first time here.</p>
<p>You have no idea what you just found here.</p>
<p>What if it’s your birth story? Your history? Or The One?</p>
<p>The most important thing about you is you. Remember you are all of you is.</p>
