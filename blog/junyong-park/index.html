<p>In the year 2183: in the year 2185, the players were getting ready to play in the first challenge they would play in the MMO, The Nexus. Although the challenge was originally for only four people, its creator left behind some clues saying that he never wanted to make more challenges for MNO. This led to discussions which eventually got them to create a challenge for the player base to see for themselves. This Challenge had to be completed in a period of five hours. Of course most players failed it, which lead to the announcement of the game being canned for that challenge. This was done by The Nexus to all who had yet to play the game.</p>
<p>But that is not all, after the game was canned: MMO Korea hosted the first ever true challenge to gamers. The gamers had to play it and win it in something short of five hours, which is 5 straight hours of competition. The name for the contest was &amp;#x27;The Last Crusade.&amp;#x27; Of course it was not for five hours that the player was watching, but something that takes at least that long, and with no in-game rewards as we&amp;#x27;ve seen before where rewards are given instantly.</p>
<p>It was finally announced, The Last Crusade has been officially announced and on November 5th, The Last Crusade was officially released with the first run of gamers witnessing its results. The game started off with 3 new races, Vikings, Viking and Human. Vikings are a cross between an early Celtic warrior race and Viking warriors of old. Vikings come in many forms, even Vikings can be different classes. Vikings are the first new races that the game introduces to players at the start of the game, they have no resistance and can resist for as long as the player wishes. Viking can be more ranged based. Vikings can also use spells and have the ability to charm certain creatures. Viking may also be somewhat favored by the Dragon Age team. The Human race, like its opposite, the Humanoid, is hard to notice since they all have the same body type. Though humans gain very little skill in game, they do tend to get worse as the game progresses.</p>
<p>Vikr went through a slight decline after it was released. Human had a bit of a bump in the middle of the game. The majority of the time they are quite mediocre, though they did increase their starting skill at the end.</p>
