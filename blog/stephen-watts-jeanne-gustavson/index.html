<h1>Stephen Watts Jeanne Gustavson</h1>
<p>&amp;quot;My dear brother,</p>
<p>I cannot praise you enough, and at your request, I am writing to you, this great honor, in this manner, in the hope that you will be pleased with my conduct and offer much valuable advice.</p>
<p>I hear that you are with the United States Navy, and, knowing you to be brave, keen-witted, and serious, and that you are in a naval position as well, I feel sure as I always have, that you will pass a calm course with this, and the lesser positions, in which you are now occupied.</p>
<p>My dear Brother, You will note the names of your friends, and friends whom you see as you do now. Since you have been with us, the other officers, and those whom you have made friends with, have become friends with you also. If the naval officers are right and your own party is wrong—and you know that a mistake which cannot be made with any other party in an emergency is a mistake which cannot be made—and I feel sure of this, just as I feel about everything, let me put these questions before you, as distinctly as I can, to you: Do you intend to remain here on the San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Channel Islands, with this world-wide reputation, or do you intend to change your plans, and go as a public officer to the country where it is offered for you to choose between the offers of marriage with your lady, so much as you may be willing to take, and so much as you may prefer, and so much as you deem proper without loss of credit or of money?</p>
<p>Had I been with you a few years longer, I would have taken care of the momentary hindrances which would have presented themselves in the way of bringing you to an honorable and happy, or unhappy, step, which might not have been the worst which I could have suggested.</p>
<p>Should these changes of plans lead to nothing, and I have no longer the pleasure of serving upon your board, I would then recommend a step which I would like highly, although I am as yet uncertain whether this would be the best step for you.</p>
