<h1>Pal Rai Yuk</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>An internal branch of the highly secretive NSO organization, the “Arkyot Mandalama” is responsible for a number of political and military infractions within the Indian state, and is known for carrying out terror raids, assassinations and attempts to disrupt the political dynamics in the neighboring state of Sikkim. Known to be a puppet and tool of the Chinese, the Mandalama is a black ops organization that is tasked with taking out the various political leaders and civilian politicians within Sikkim which pose an immediate threat to the Chinese. The Mandalama has ties to the NSO led by the influential “Thapa” Mandalama.</p>
<p>The Mandalama in furtherance of this agenda has now gotten news of an imminent assault that they have made on a poor peasant farmer named in a recent article by local news publication ‘Guru Bonga’, currently working under a cloud with a restraining order in place. On the night of November 26th, 2015, armed men forcefully brought the farmer to a police station where the man was questioned by a local police officer for an hour.</p>
<p>The policeman took the young man aside and informed him that he is a suspected party to a mass assassination. He was also informed that although the man is originally from this village, his past links have forced them to come and arrest him for just being “illegally” in this state. His parents are now now unable to feed him. As a consequence he will have to be relocated from his own village to someplace upstate just to care for him on a strictly government budget.</p>
<p>Though what could possibly be “illegitimizing” about this particular case is evident through the fact that no questions were answered to the teenager’s why, where and how he came into possession of his weapons, the only information he received that night was that they were for “protecting” him.</p>
<p>While this all seems to come as no surprise to the local villagers, it is in fact part and parcel of the agenda of the Mandalama for what seems to be a very large-scale political assassination since his name is now also being linked to “he’s dead” by the local media.</p>
