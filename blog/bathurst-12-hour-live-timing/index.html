<h1>Bathurst 12 Hour Live Timing</h1>
<p>Timing is one of the most important aspects of a race. With so many exciting events it can sometimes be difficult to find out just what time something happens. This could be caused by rain or who knows what else. But in the FIA World Endurance Championship the clock is used to time the start of races and a couple of points either way. For the Bathurst 12 Hour event, each car has a start time shown on the clock under &amp;quot;time to race&amp;quot; in the left column. If it ticks out then we know the start of the race is on time. If it doesn&amp;#x27;t it means a driver change has been made.</p>

</p>
<p>The GP Team Start Time in this scenario is based on the car being in the centre of the grid. This means the driver who does the laps will start and end at the same time on each lap. However, from many of the races at the circuit, the GP Team is usually situated in a section of the track where starts and finishes are in different portions. Therefore, in the first two minutes of each lap, drivers are assigned spots to get as close to the starting grid as they can and finish in grid position as close to the driver who starts. A driver can start over and start again if he wants.</p>
<p>Drivers are also sorted into &amp;quot;aces&amp;quot;, which basically means they are always in the same position at the front of the grid. A driver who finishes first will necessarily finish first at the next race, so drivers have to stand on time in order to be grouped into two-digit positions.</p>
