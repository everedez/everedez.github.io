Flood Map Disaster Map
A friend of mine asked me how to apply this Tandem Disaster map to the tornado in Ohio. If you are in the Great Lakes or at least nearby, you may have called to your local meteorologist to see if they have something.">

Flood Map Disaster Map<br>
</p>
<p>A friend of mine asked me how to apply this Tandem Disaster map to the tornado in Ohio. If you are in the Great Lakes or at least nearby, you may have called to your local meteorologist to see if they have something...</p>
<p>As I started to create the map I kept thinking, well, how can I put it in such a short way? The idea is simple... I&amp;#x27;ll just take a pretty decent satellite image, crop it, use a few filters, and make a gif.</p>
<p>Below, you can see the result:</p>
<p>I have yet to make a single image like it, but some of my own of this storm is available on Youtube (I found a video in this very thread while creating the map).</p>
<p>You will notice, that there is a sharp white crescent-shaped line running east to west at various distances away from the center of the storm. This pattern is the tornado with two distinct tornadic waves.</p>
<p>Might also note the location of the major high-tide mark (frozen in time as far as I know)</p>
<p>This is not a scientific evidence, but I like to use like-things when doing any kind of hand-waving. This is a topic I am planning for an upcoming article I hope.</p>
<p>Next time I would like to show images to make the point about the scale/distance by which high-tide marks will appear on this.</p>
<p>I must be boring you in some negative way, but I would like to show the nice high-tide marks to those who are unaware of them. Of course, you can create your own maps, but until then, here it is... The tornado in Ohio the other day...</p>
<p>Note the video I sent you here... (didn&amp;#x27;t create it on my own, just found it) and below I made a few screenshots to show how easy it would be to use this map to create the videos.</p>
<p>Also, here is a preview of what the next posts will be about...</p>
