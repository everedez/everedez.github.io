Conspiracy theory.
An “idea” that seems to have no reality.
The first was inspired by a chat with Thomas Wilstrup on Reddit.com (the first post I ever wrote) and subsequently introduced the idea to friends, family, and co-workers. The chat was easily a fun way to pass the time, as it presented weird ideas that were thought up real fast. The first of which was “an undercover Obama operation in Maryland.">

<h1>Phil Gennusa Danbury</h1>
<p>
Origins<br>
Conspiracy theory.<br>
An “idea” that seems to have no reality.<br>
</p>
<p>The first was inspired by a chat with Thomas Wilstrup on Reddit.com (the first post I ever wrote) and subsequently introduced the idea to friends, family, and co-workers. The chat was easily a fun way to pass the time, as it presented weird ideas that were thought up real fast. The first of which was “an undercover Obama operation in Maryland.” This post was inspired by this Reddit post.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I visited my most obnoxious law firms as an advance undergraduate, at my first summer job after college. The two leading law firms in Maryland (doubled my output) were:</p>
<h2>Raymond James &amp;amp; Associates</h2>
<p>The next year my firm quit outsourcing to India. They were nice to take the time out of their busy practice, to have lunch with me, which led to the idea of a “handful” of law firms helping to develop the Republican party in various capacities. Eventually I was able to do internships at my two biggest law firms so I could see the type of work that would turn him or her into an asset. Since this group was being built up with the same vision, the name “Revolution Law” should have been just as effective. It didn’t though, since I was brought in as first office manager and run it to a good but “usual” finish. The president, before leaving the presidency decided to name his replacement, “the Revolution Law Group” (Lambert and Caputo went on from this group, eventually taking on the “Presidential Transition Group”). This early career staff and me was a group that helped shape the future administration in Washington for the Republican party in the following four years.</p>
<p>The second major idea was more obviously inspired by the conservative movement. It was when I was helping to get lawyers to register to vote and I was impressed at how willing some of the Republican candidates seemed to show their support for getting to know their constituents. Like any good conservative organizer, it also had the purpose of allowing all registered voters to see the support of registered leaders for the same candidate at the same time. These two ideas were running together when I got a second year.</p>
