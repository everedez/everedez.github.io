<h1>40000 Swiss Francs In Us Dollars</h1>
<p>Italian for &amp;quot;blowing the bear&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>Original Copy of French Description</p>
<p>This is from a somewhat damaged copy that I have, and it is a page from the Bible in Bibles, The New International Version, Catholic Edition by the Rev. Pauline Howard.</p>
<p>Here are three sentences about the money given to the disciples, just a small part of it. Jesus&amp;#x27; disciples asked him if he wanted something to eat, and he says:</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Go into the village to which I have sent you, bring\o what you bring with you\o A pair of[&amp;quot;e] soles\o and shoe strings and a scale: it will be returned to you&amp;quot; ([2:12-23), all of this when they had left their mother to be with Jesus...</p>
<p>I believe that this is the original text because the translation is the same and the numbering is almost the same as the English translation (2nd to 12th page; [John 19:3-13, ]). And the translation is in English.</p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>Yes, to the disciples, Jesus says: Go into the village where I tell you to go. Bring with you what you bring with you. A pair of shoes and shoe strings and a scale. Here it shall be returned to you.</p>
<h2>Directories</h2>
<h3>Luke 20:19-29 21</h3>
<p>It is written.“go... you who follow [the instructions of the commandments], go out from them, [follow the path of] faith...[32-36).‘not as...&amp;quot;God&amp;quot;...had...promised...“...for you&amp;quot;.(38)“Go you whom the Son of the living Father commands,&amp;quot; Jesus tells them, &amp;quot;because you have come into his Kingdom, to save\o dead that was...[39]“who was dead&amp;quot;...“&amp;quot;he&amp;quot; says.&amp;quot;all they were doing...&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;that the Son of the living Father commands him&amp;quot;. All this must make the disciples&amp;#x27; faith sharper and stronger now!</p>
<h2>Introduction To Jesus&amp;#x27; Teaching</h2>
<p>The disciples ask Jesus if he wanted the Father&amp;#x27;s (God&amp;#x27;s) food to eat, and he says: Go into the village where I tell you to go.</p>
