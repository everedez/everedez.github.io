Previous weeks, as I noted, I profiled a few atheist friends who support a belief that the Earth is a sphere. This week, I’m looking for others, the more ardent, who not only refuse to believe but actively reject that sphere in all its glory. “Shape” is one of the first words that springs to mind. For most of us, we’ve all been taught that the Earth is a sphere, and everyone we know has read a book or two that encourages us to believe that what we see in the sky from our homes on Earth are glims.">

<h1>Perses D God Roll</h1>

<p>Previous weeks, as I noted, I profiled a few atheist friends who support a belief that the Earth is a sphere. This week, I’m looking for others, the more ardent, who not only refuse to believe but actively reject that sphere in all its glory. “Shape” is one of the first words that springs to mind. For most of us, we’ve all been taught that the Earth is a sphere, and everyone we know has read a book or two that encourages us to believe that what we see in the sky from our homes on Earth are glims. We think we’ve seen them too, and we want to live in fear of losing the opportunity to watch that view from as distant as Saturn from our home in space; we want to live in fear of what we will see from afar on the heavens beyond our home. We want to live in fear simply because the chance is there, and we’ll find them.</p>
<p>I don’t always want to ask questions, but the first time we ever saw that star over us is why I was so terrified of flying and the fear I had was then why I ended up being a student. In 1981 my dad flew some times from New York to Florida in a Piper Cub, paying for the plane by working nights at my dad’s auto repair shop. He used the opportunity of my home, our garage, to fly from his garage to our place in the country to have a few rides. After some vacation time getting places and visiting friends in the area, we went back to Orlando full of new excitement and eagerness for those first moments and moments of a new place to go.</p>
<p>He came back loaded with tales of what the night sky was like, and we talked so much as to figure out which stars we might see that first time as it would be home ground with the most obvious, “See a tail-fin!” and “I saw a green goo.”</p>
<p>He was excited and with excitement, and the idea of coming back to Orlando before school started, I think of the stories I would write home, some of the exciting new stories I might share with my family and friends as I quickly learn, over the course of my life, that space, the heavens, and the Earth are all very different things.</p>
