<p>Photo of a fallen tree that was ripped from the Hudson River and dropped into the East River west of Manhattan on April Fools Day in October 2010. The city went into a partial blackout after the storm was blamed for a massive power outage.</p>
<p>The city of New York has opened its doors to snow covered commuters as a flurry of snow continues to fall there, making what is normally the coldest city to date.</p>
<p>However, the New York International Airport has declared a holiday today to go into a snow-free zone, and the New York City traffic department is urging its drivers to use their horns to alert others of their presence.</p>
<p>Particulate matter, which has the most potency at the New York City airport, was measured in downtown offices at 2.4 micrograms per cubic meter, down from a March 2012 study which said it was 3 micrograms.</p>
