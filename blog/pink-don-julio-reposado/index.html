<h1>Pink Don Julio Reposado</h1>
<p>As for the other Beatles albums, I tried to capture each one of them as they were released, whether it was their debut solo album in Abbey Road, the second album in Harrison&amp;#x27;s solo career, the album in Rubberband if they were a band playing together (Paul, George and Ringo on this), or John&amp;#x27;s solo albums for Decca. In addition to each album&amp;#x27;s title and cover, I left off any recording dates or CDs, simply because every album has its own style and feel. So for example, George&amp;#x27;s initial albums were classic albums, such as Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road, White Album, while John and Paul&amp;#x27;s first solo albums were more uptempo music with their own distinct sound.</p>
<p>The main differences in this collection of photos is that there are, since the 80s, a lot of color images, although they might not always include the album cover. All the photos are shot by me, or are taken by a friend that I knew well, as I was friends with all the artists on the band. And there are no images of the Beatles in any band photo.</p>
<p>Some of the photographs are found here, but some are at the John Lennon Archive and Documented History of the John Lennon Anthology.</p>
<h2>The Anthology/Yoko Ono Files</h2>
<p>Every one of these albums is full of interviews. Some of the interviews are in color, while the ones where they are black and white are from the album liner notes. My favorite part of the Anthology interview is at the end, when John and Yoko are interviewed. The interview is quite interesting because of the way each musician talked about each subject in more detail and with more depth then previous interviews and it truly gives you a different perspective. The interviews have their own nice ending, with a nice nice moment where John gives Yoko hugs. The last interview, in which George takes the microphone to tell Yoko about his life and how he feels about her, is quite lovely too. If it doesn&amp;#x27;t appear in the photos it&amp;#x27;s because that is just a filler.</p>
<h2>The Anthology/Yoko Ono Files</h2>
<p>My favorite albums are probably &amp;quot;Dear Prudence&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sgt Pepper&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Blue&amp;quot;, all three are great for history students, but can also be considered classics in their own right.</p>
