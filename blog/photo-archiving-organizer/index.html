<h1>Photo Archiving Organizer</h1>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The purpose of archiving is to enable the preservation of information that is personally important to people, places, activities, events and systems of all kinds. The archiving process involves carefully recorded formats. This includes all formats that are digital or contain the information you wish to protect. It includes files as well as their container forms (directories) based on specific object formats, and specific component file formats (e.g., components; e.g., images). It also involves access controls, user controls, and the storage of metadata, for example. The archiving process allows you to access specific files and to not delete them at a given point in time, or to mark them for deletion on demand as you wish.</p>
<h2>Project Organization</h2>
<p>This is a collection of existing archiving processes in use in the technology domain at any level of hierarchy as appropriate. The current work in progress is to update this list, which includes descriptions of processes, the types of metadata that are maintained, storage areas, types of activities/documents archived, the media involved, how these archives work or can be generated, and the backup/reliability, backups, and integration formats. The initial list will also be reviewed for its adequacy as a resource for documenting and testing other archive processes and infrastructure components as part of the community&amp;#x27;s work to provide a generalized framework for archiving.</p>
<p>Notes from the Archives to Edit</p>
<p>This project strives to make information about how archives work and their various components accessible to the wider public through providing archive processes, specifications, tools, and examples. This archive-building effort is facilitated by a directory of archive notes with descriptions and links to documentation, as well as archiving technical resources that support the various processes. The site is to become a convenient portal through which archives can be navigated and explored. A particular focus is put on archiving technologies as well as operational methods that can leverage these technologies to create and support archives. For example, this archive is designed to discuss archiving and testing considerations required to support data collection; the need to enhance archiving security; and the nature of archive processes, formats, and backups.</p>
<p>Traditionally when a new archive needs to be constructed because it contains sensitive information (e.g., personal information), the process has been to carefully consider what, if any, information should be discarded.</p>
