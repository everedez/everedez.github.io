<h1>Wonderfully Made Christmas Bazaar</h1>
<p>
by: giovanni dolce cappello, dolce cappello at maclary groties.com<br>
Some people were telling me: &amp;quot;it depends on your health&amp;quot;.<br>
They were right; I wasn&amp;#x27;t taking into account the condition of the work, which<br>
was very sad and very dull. Just once I met a man (on a motorcycle that had<br>
crashed in a no-good alley!) who welcomed me and welcomed me to a wonderful<br>
coffeehouse with this very charming man who with whom was really very<br>
friendly. The coffee was great, and at the same time very heavy: but my heart was<br>
happy, indeed. I told him that I had read in a book and did not understand his<br>
words: but the most incredible thing was that he understood me. So I decided to<br>
add this little wine to my &amp;quot;made holiday&amp;quot; with my daughter Lina.<br>
I got, at the best table, for example, two cheeses (one red of Pecorino Romano<br>
and the other, with a rooster - very unusual - and two olives (white),<br>
one with some almonds. The wine I drank was very good, white, dark red wine, and<br>
was delicious. Afterwards, I took one look at my lovely daughter and<br>
said: &amp;quot;good, but there&amp;#x27;s something missing in the price&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#x27;s<br>
some other detail...&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Tell me what it is&amp;quot;, I said. And to tell you the truth<br>
I won&amp;#x27;t show him until Christmas.<br>
The mazza was delicious and very generous. Even I was not in much better<br>
condition, and I didn&amp;#x27;t drink much, but I thought the table was extremely<br>
special (and I see that was the intention of the chef). The wine was very<br>
sweet, heavy (due to the mazza), and just delicious. The cheese was<br>
excellent (the Romano, actually it was the best that day), the glasses were<br>
tender and the bread was very tasty.<br>
A friend of my mother said: &amp;quot;And there&amp;#x27;s a real surprise, you get four<br>
pieces of cake: for example, the truffle cream and the tiramisu!<br>
