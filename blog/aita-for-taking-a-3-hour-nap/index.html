<h1>Aita For Taking A 3 Hour Nap</h1>
<p>On February 12th I started my last 8 weeks of running at the Boulder run. I had officially begun at 8:30. I had then planned on finishing. I was running fast enough; I was looking forward to my favorite warmup. I was just getting going in the right direction after an amazing Colorado run and was ready for my break. I was running on the same route that the last 8 weeks of the A.M. Rocky Run had taken me, towards Boulder. I would have finished if it didn&amp;#x27;t happen to cross a bridge. I turned left off the road into the parking lot and ran toward the bridge, away from the road, letting my feet hang over the arch. I got off the arch with a splash and then my right foot slipped off the arch altogether. I hit hard in the midfoot and had a wicked pain-in-my-eye. I didn’t take my time. Next to a pipe, I pulled on my shoes. I wasn’t going to cut corners in finishing. For the first 12 miles I slowly ran until I caught my shoes and ran my short trail back to the parking lot again. Before I gave it all my energy to gear for the run I watched the pain-in-my-eye grow. I decided to run with my nose glued to the ground. I pulled my right heel up to my chin, did that again and dug in to release that backside. I cleared my lungs in 8th. I had 8 hours of energy left. 9 miles to go. My stomach sat, tense. I knew I had to get my legs going. I crawled the length of the course, one block just before starting the next block, and then one block straight back up to the parking lot so my feet wouldn&amp;#x27;t cramp up. I breathed deeply in short gasps and then there was a sigh and my right foot pulled back out off the arch. My right foot was dangling; I pulled up my shoe by the edge of the arch all the way up and then brought my left foot up. I realized I had made a poor choice, it hurt so badly it was all I could do not to drop my shoe and bring my foot back down. I had to bring my foot past the arch but I was thankful that it did. I eased up my shoe, again released the backside and breathed.</p>
