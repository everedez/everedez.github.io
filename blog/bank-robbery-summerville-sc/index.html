<h1>Bank Robbery Summerville Sc</h1>
<p>Editor&amp;#x27;s Notes: That&amp;#x27;s all but an excuse for the usual drunken crowd to be at the country scene, but not without consequences.</p>
<p>It seems like every week you get a new reminder you should be alert for them. No two incidents are the same -- you never know who could be involved -- and there&amp;#x27;s always someone trying to be clever. So let&amp;#x27;s check out the latest robbin&amp;#x27; &amp;quot;sport.&amp;quot;</p>
<h2>July</h2>
<p>http://www.wymattsc.org/robbing_summerville_sc.php July 24th -- This weekend&amp;#x27;s Doublecross Robbery is on July 24th.</p>
<p>July 24th -- And you just plain knew it by now, but the July 24th Doublecross Robbery happened because some would rather be hanging out with their drug of choice than go about performing their duties.</p>
<h2>August</h2>
<p>August 1st -- The second Longest Icy Drive in Virginia is scheduled to happen on August 28th. The chase continues after a roadblock at the intersection of Carter-Henry and Rockbridge County roads.</p>
<p>August 2nd -- Three cars were spotted on the Sumter County Turn Road. The vehicles were seen driving around the outside of a road closure.</p>
<p>August 6th -- The &amp;quot;Speed Bug&amp;quot; is rumored to be in town. Because of the current Winterfest Committee meeting Saturday, everyone was getting cold weather at the beginning of the official Robbing Summerville Sc competition.</p>
<p>August 7th -- Meetup with the Speed Bug leads to a second meetup at Shiloh Baptist Church with Kile McInerny, the team&amp;#x27;s coach. This is Kile&amp;#x27;s first time with the team and she&amp;#x27;s also the team&amp;#x27;s new coach.</p>
<p>August 11th -- Kile shows up for the first Kila-Kool challenge (opposite the BFI) with Alex Edwards to learn about the BFI&amp;#x27;s code of conduct. They had their first try-out as a team at the Recreation Center with several of the kids from Shiloh Baptist.</p>
<p>August 26th -- It has come to the attention of the team that Bill Rice will be in town for the Robbing Summerville Sc&amp;#x27;s that day.</p>
