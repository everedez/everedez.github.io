<h1>Bergara B14 Hmr</h1>
<p>Only a few days earlier, the news of the death of the former Prime Minster, Abiy Ahmed, was reported by a journalist in his hometown of Tarabani, in Nigeria. The news was immediately picked up by Nigerians, who called Abiy Ahmed an &amp;#x27;Almighty&amp;#x27; and &amp;#x27;the son of Allah.&amp;#x27; The journalist, on the basis of what he saw, declared that Abiy Ahmed was killed by the Nigerian government. The journalist was one of those who made headlines nationwide in 2002 by denouncing the killing of prominent public officials. In his account in the media, he described Abiy Ahmed as &amp;#x27;a man with few good memories.&amp;#x27;</p>
<p>That was far from the truth, but it was no secret from anyone who lived near Tarabani when Abiy Ahmed was leading Nigeria into a new life. Those who lived in the rural areas of Tarabani rarely passed through the narrow spaces in which Abiy Ahmed lived. If they did, they did so only on foot, climbing trees or wading through shallow rivers. The few people who did come and to Tarabani to visit Abiy Ahmed had to cross his land.</p>
<p>The &amp;#x27;Abayi Villa&amp;#x27; was the compound of the family that owned it. The entire domain was owned by Mr. BadiBariji and his wife, Mrs. Abimbola Bibi. The land was separated into several lots by walls. Lots 1-4 were owned by Mr BadiBariji&amp;#x27;s family, and lots 5-7 by his wife, Mrs Abimbola. A few times Mr BadiBariji and Mrs Abimbola would repair the gates to get in and out. They lived in the compound, and then started their own family in it. The main house was in good repair in 1997. It had two bedrooms, a kitchen, a dining room and a room in which both of their five children gathered and slept. The other parts of the house were furnished with wooden boards. Not far from the main house, there was a shed called the &amp;#x27;Farm shed,&amp;#x27; a tool shed, an animal shed, a bullock shed, a chicken shed and a couple of small sheds, one for chickens and one for cows. The yard had a maize field, a maize bed and a maize porch.</p>
