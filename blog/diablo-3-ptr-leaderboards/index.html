<h1>Diablo 3 Ptr Leaderboards</h1>
<p>During the last week players transitioned from Patch 9.1 to Patch 10.3.</p>
<p>This article features a brief explain of any changes made to ranked play that may come into a player’s possession based on our interpretation of the new system found in Patch 10.</p>
<p>To begin with, we have released a FAQ, where we ask players to provide a short description of any gameplay/warp/shooting changes they are seeing in Patch 10. We then award a random portion of this information to each player once the application form is filled out by the user.</p>
<p>Players are also informed about possible balance changes and any balancing updates in the PTR notes section (s) or in the community.</p>
<p>We have also added a “Suspend or Release” option in the Control Panel. This will prevent you from playing if you’ve chosen to do so, in addition to the immediate and prolonged (1 hour) issues previously reported.</p>
<p>In Patch 10.1, new balance changes were made and clarified. We look forward to your feedback on the new rules.</p>
<p>What is the new system in patch 10.3?</p>
<p>Players transition to Patch 10.3 based off of one of two options. Either you have completed the last 90 days if you are participating in the “Ultimate Rewards” system. This is the same as the 10.3 patch but has an additional feature of our current feedback scoring system.</p>
<p>If you have not completed the full 90 day period of eligibility, you are still eligible at the same point in time. Players who have moved in the original direction (From Patch 9, to 10) need to only do a single “PTR Experience” in order to qualify in the new system. The single “PTR Experience” will now only be the first “Kill Chain”. If you complete a PTR, you will continue to get those achievements.</p>
<p>In our PTR announcement, we acknowledged the fact that even if you passed through the previous 90 day period of eligibility, you may do a single PTR if you wish to so.</p>
<p>In the new system, we also found that a few players were experiencing issues with the new process and we are looking into solutions to this new system.</p>
