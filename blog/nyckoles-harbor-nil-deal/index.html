<h1>Nyckoles Harbor Nil Deal</h1>
<p>Diesel: CAB 522 in block B with PBT equipment from NOXX, block M on the other side of the street, and block A is behind and lower than CAB 522 about 30 feet. Block B could also be put in block V, a 2x4 that runs along the water, if they kept the block B all the way to the water.</p>
<p>Nil: I realize it would be cheaper to deal with the lake, but also, I would rather not go below $20/ea. So I prefer a price and certainty of not going below that. $60-100 would cost more, a bit of certainty than going below that would make sense.</p>
<p>Diesel: Plastics that go to block B would include everything from PS to PVC, and an RV that goes up to block B and does not have a 5 foot water line would not need to be special built (?)</p>
<p>That&amp;#x27;s a lot of dollars and what I don&amp;#x27;t need are bags, and such to put it into. I don&amp;#x27;t want to go too much below 15 c/mp. but I certainly don&amp;#x27;t want to go below 10 c/mp.</p>
<p>Plus, the fish would need more support because of the weight of the water, the weight of the fish, the weight of the fish swim time, the weight of the pond, the weight of the boater, the depth of the pond, and the weight of the pond water</p>
<p>Plus, we could plant trees. Let&amp;#x27;s plant them at the pond instead of being used as a fish pond. If that can be done with the 2 beds in the same planter place. If it can be done all with 1 or 2 beds then that could work.</p>
<p>My boat gets used for a little less than 1 hour per day, but that&amp;#x27;s also the only time I get out there, between weekends and long weekends.</p>
<p>Plus, fish are quite interesting there, and I am sure there are fish to catch, and to feed. The pond has some algae, and the lack of leaves gets messy when they&amp;#x27;re green.</p>
<p>Plus, there is an entire town right there, that area with a harbor, which would be a real pleasant town to visit once you go up there. Lots of good shops, and fishing.</p>
