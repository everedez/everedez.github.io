The Diverse Fraud Claims
The facts of fraud are complex. Many fraud claims are based upon complex understandings such as promissory or agency (intentional) fraud. Promissory fraud involves a promise made in exchange for the right to receive a valuable right (exchange). An agent is a person to whom another person agrees to give certain powers and then does something to allow the other person to receive those powers in the future.">

Diverse Fraud Claims<br>
Where Does Good Law Go Wrong?<br>
The Diverse Fraud Claims<br>
</p>
<p>The facts of fraud are complex. Many fraud claims are based upon complex understandings such as promissory or agency (intentional) fraud. Promissory fraud involves a promise made in exchange for the right to receive a valuable right (exchange). An agent is a person to whom another person agrees to give certain powers and then does something to allow the other person to receive those powers in the future. In Promissory fraud, the only agreed action that the other party does is the promise to give the power to act while he is in the position to receive it himself. For example, Mary asks Jane to tell her to write her name on your will. There is an implied condition that the will will be valid as long as you are alive. So Mary agrees that you will look after your estate, and Jane agrees to do whatever it is that Mr. McTeague asks you to do. Jane agrees to do this when you are both in your office or when you both retire that day. This provides both the authority and the guarantee.</p>
<p>All the &amp;quot;promises&amp;quot; are missing or false. The problem here is that Mary is making promises to be very careful whether she is to write your name on your will, and there is only one person she is promising any rights to ever be involved with the will. She is either making the will only for herself or only for yourself. Which is worse? Unless you are going to argue that Jane is committing a crime, you should decide, then, which agency fraud is worse.</p>
<p>This does not mean that every promise made by Mary is false. It would be the same if you said to Edward that he has to do this or that if you were to die first, but Mary is agreeing that what she is promising in exchange for something in exchange for her promise of another person is not false but is that promise illegal? No, because if it is a promise of the authority to act, then the authorities will also act themselvesâ€”they are a partnership and are partners in that they both are taking responsibility to act in order for Jane to get what she has promised. She cannot deceive them by telling them she will be carrying out a promise of the authority to act. This includes the authority to act as it is in her or as it was given.</p>
