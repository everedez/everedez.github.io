If you&amp;#x27;re wondering what &amp;#x27;VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS&amp;#x27; are, they mean these actual real people who are going to make the recommendations for the POTUS. They call them&amp;#x27;recommendations&amp;#x27;; it doesn&amp;#x27;t really matter who makes them, it&amp;#x27;s very similar to what happens in the Senate. The people that actually make these recommendations get to specify the full path the &amp;#x27;POTUS&amp;#x27; would go down if he wanted to be the person that recommended those things or not and they get to tell it how much time they think that&amp;#x27;s worth.">

<p>If you&amp;#x27;re wondering what &amp;#x27;VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS&amp;#x27; are, they mean these actual real people who are going to make the recommendations for the POTUS. They call them&amp;#x27;recommendations&amp;#x27;; it doesn&amp;#x27;t really matter who makes them, it&amp;#x27;s very similar to what happens in the Senate. The people that actually make these recommendations get to specify the full path the &amp;#x27;POTUS&amp;#x27; would go down if he wanted to be the person that recommended those things or not and they get to tell it how much time they think that&amp;#x27;s worth.</p>
<p>If you think you know a little bit more than what these people have said, maybe you think the ones that weren&amp;#x27;t &amp;#x27;pro-Trump&amp;#x27; are trying to motivate you a bit because sometimes they have a tough time convincing people whose voting record is not positive.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, we want to hear from you. You can just write in your opinion by clicking this link or you can email it to Votecare@trumpprinciples.org and we&amp;#x27;ll compile it here for everyone and present it to everyone. We can also arrange a live link to your post.</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to direct your opinion about your vote and your vote&amp;#x27;s impact, we will let you choose your own section for the live voting presentation.</p>
<p>UPSC Exam Result is on March 13th.</p>
<p>Donors of a percentage of people that vote, and you&amp;#x27;ll want to explain what their voting record says about them and not your own. Or, you can submit another person. Now that is another story entirely.</p>
<p>But it&amp;#x27;s time to vote, go, go, go. Make sure you&amp;#x27;re registered and get at least one, and make sure you&amp;#x27;re voting!</p>
<p>Go back to your site and make sure to read the link to Votecare@trumpprinciples.org; we all know you will need to read this soon!</p>
<p>Vote: Stay classy, vote!</p>
