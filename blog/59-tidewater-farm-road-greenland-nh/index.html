<h1>59 Tidewater Farm Road Greenland Nh</h1>
<p>
Ansel C. Foglio of the United States Census Bureau testified that the area<br>
was a total of 66.3 acres and that it &amp;quot;weighed approximately 88.78 acres.&amp;quot;<br>
App. at 230.<br>
The government&amp;#x27;s closing argument.    The government argued to the jury<br>
that Luchuk was a &amp;quot;truck dealer,&amp;quot; and that Luchuk&amp;#x27;s selling the Tundra<br>
was one of the ways by which he obtained the sale proceeds.   The government<br>
advanced that Luchuk received over $53,000 from his Tundra sales on<br>
June 3, 1997.<br>
Testimony of Sam Luchuk.   Luchuk testified that his father operated the<br>
Roadway Sales and Tender Yard in 1998, and at that time, Luchuk had never<br>
ever seen the Tundra there.   Even though he had hired mechanics to repair<br>
the Tundra prior to July 1998, he had never owned the Tundra prior to<br>
anyone ever buying it.    He never said that the Tundra came to his<br>
house.     He recalled driving to the store and getting the truck, and then,<br>
after paying for parts on the back and the tires, turning the truck over<br>
to the mechanic.   When asked what he drove the truck to, he replied: &amp;quot;A<br>
cotton candy hauler.&amp;quot;   App. at 209.     The government produced evidence<br>
revealing that Luchuk was a &amp;quot;cotton candy hauler&amp;quot; at that point.<br>
Sentencing.<br>
