<h1>Lacy Larson Sawzall</h1>
<p>Lacey Larson Sawzall, 46, of Fayetteville, started a fire that broke out in the kitchen of a home on Wheeler Drive approximately an hour on Saturday morning, Dec. 31, 2017, after a party. She was trying to pull off a plan to enter a grocery store nearby. (Charleston County Sheriff’s Office, Travis Reaves)</p>
<p>According to police, Lacy Larson Sawzall, 46, of Fayetteville, was intoxicated when she started a fire at a home on Wheeler Drive after a party. She was able to retreat inside her home and called for help before she could do anything. She was arrested on charges of first-degree arson and criminal mischief on Tuesday (May 11) at the sheriff’s office and is currently being held without bond.</p>
<p>Investigators and the Charleston County Sheriff’s Office believe that the two incidents were related. A judge ordered Lacy Sawzall held without bond on Monday until the Marshall County Sheriff’s Office could speak with her.</p>
<p>Three other people were also arrested for crimes in connection with the fires: Shane Johnson, 30; T.E.B. Brown, 61; and Samuel Anderson, 30.</p>
<p>Johnson has been charged with arson and criminal mischief related to the fire at the home on Wheeler Drive. According to police, he intentionally started a fire at the home so he could break in and steal money. He was arrested on Sunday (Aug. 16) evening.</p>
<p>This week, detectives and the sheriff’s office were trying to identify the owner of the home that Lacy Sawzall and her two guests, Shane Johnson and T.E.B. Brown, were living in. The home was being remodeled but the owners had moved out the previous day.</p>
<p>T.E.B. Brown was arrested Dec. 28, 2017, on charges of burglary, escape from lawful custody and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on Nov. 11, 2017, after he attacked a man who came to the home to ask for directions because of a severe kitchen explosion. He will be held without bond.</p>
<p>Shane Johnson was arrested Dec. 28, 2017, on charges of third-degree arson and carrying a gun without a licence. He is still being held without bond on those charges at the East Carolina Sheriff’s Office.</p>
