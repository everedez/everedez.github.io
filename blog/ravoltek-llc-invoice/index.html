<h1>Ravoltek Llc Invoice</h1>

<h3>EXCLUSIVE</h3>
<p>1 year after an upscale hotel hosted the pricey &amp;quot;Survivor&amp;#x27;s Curse,&amp;quot; rumors are flying that some of the South Beach venue&amp;#x27;s marquee parties may have a future after all.</p>
<p>The rumor: High profile guests are being asked to pay to play at a new party being hosted in the upscale Central Park hotspot. The exclusive bash scheduled for Nov. 17 is being called a &amp;quot;rivalry party&amp;quot; and will feature appearances by celebrities such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Tina Fey and Ashley Tisdale, among others.</p>
<p>Rumor #2: The &amp;quot;rivalry party&amp;quot; may be hosted by... &amp;#x27;Lawrence Welk&amp;#x27; -- not a South Beach &amp;#x27;Survivor&amp;#x27;s Curse&amp;#x27; attendee, but one of his top regional acts.</p>
<p>The rumor: Now that the hotel is moving away from the &amp;quot;Curse&amp;quot; and into a new phase, Lawrence Welk -- known as a hit on the West Coast -- may be contacted to throw the party.</p>
<p>Lawrence Welk, 35, has a new TV show, &amp;quot;Legion,&amp;quot; and is about to begin shooting a movie in January, but there&amp;#x27;s still interest in attending the rivalry party. TMZ broke the news.</p>
<p>The South Beach hotel which specializes in events like &amp;quot;Dancing With The Stars&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&amp;quot; is located on Central Park West. At press time, we&amp;#x27;re told the Hotel had already booked nearly 4,000 people for the Nov. 17 party, where attendees will be entertained by performances by artists such as Lenny Kravitz, Celine Dion and Glen Campbell.</p>
<p>Here&amp;#x27;s what one attendee said about the party... &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s definitely going to be the same amount to how many other events are held up and you can go to wherever you want. The hotel keeps changing what is going to happen. There are certain things are sure to not work anymore, but what is going to happen is going to be the same all the time. So, for me personally, it&amp;#x27;s exciting. I&amp;#x27;ve been to a lot of the hotel parties that have been held all over the place and it&amp;#x27;s always exciting.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>But there&amp;#x27;s a caveat -- despite all of the attention going to the &amp;quot;Curse,&amp;quot; it won&amp;#x27;t be happening at the exact same time.</p>
