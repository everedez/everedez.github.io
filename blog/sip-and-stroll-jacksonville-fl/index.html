<h1>Sip And Stroll Jacksonville Fl</h1>
<p>Sip And Stroll Jacksonville Fl was launched in 2016 and located at the Sandtown Harbor Hotel, a 50 year old hotel located on the waterfront in Jacksonville, Florida. It began as a café that was renovated, then settled into a casual spot on the lakeside from the back patio, where a small but lively crowd gathered to drink, socialize, and let the local celebrities sway every once in a while on the reggaeton stage and also do some of their own performing karaoke music.</p>
<p>The newest addition to the property is an entertainment hub set for the times. As those of you who have been following my podcast for a while will know, I generally like staying close to the shows that I love, and there are some great local entertainers on display at Sip And Stroll. The group includes notable actors and actresses along with various local singers. There is a fun new entrance hall that sits behind the stage, and three separate room formats. There is the whole floor set up where you can sit and make the floor shake, and there is a more intimate format where there is a private room that will seat up to an artist and just get you into their performing or any other type of energy you may have. The venue is tucked inside so the audience can watch but not get too close for comfort.</p>
<p>If you are a big fan of reggaeton, then you will have probably seen this one a few times. The group is known for being the most open to keeping a certain type of character always at the forefront of the scene and this is no exception. The group, known for having their own famous producer as well, has built quite the following for themselves, with much of their own original and very accomplished artist that they have at the helm. Before I go into specifics, the following people have been a big part in building a fan base and following the performers:</p>
<p>
Soyboy Flex Jr<br>
Shakur<br>
Mani Semal V<br>
Camelo<br>
T-Stop<br>
Xpeelo<br>
xixPinch<br>
Mando Prito<br>
B1Quz<br>
Maaloxx<br>
Enchilad<br>
Bosa<br>
And more…<br>
Obviously, any good entertainment group should not have the least concern about doing their own private production.<br>
