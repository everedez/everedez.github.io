<p>Sprint users, we just sent an email to your web browser telling you to visit www.battleground.com to share a game trailer.</p>
<p>Share it when the match begins, and with the help of our awesome volunteers and communities, we can create a cinematic gaming experience worthy of a 2017 NBA championship celebration. For your comfort and convenience, please refresh your browser.</p>

<p>We know some of you might be disappointed that a new tech center opened up on our beloved grounds, but our future is not without hope that they will re-accelerate the growth and development of this gem of a community.</p>
<p>The response has been extremely favorable, and we would love to work together to make the full experience even better. Share your thoughts and thanks for playing.</p>
<p>One more time: What a great idea!</p>
<p>Now, in order to play the free game:</p>
<p>1. Go to the website and hit “Get Mobile Game.”<br>
2. Decide what mobile device you want to use, and hit the “Download Game” button.<br>
3. On the web page you should have a “Download Android Download” or “Download iOS Download” button.<br>
4. Click on the button and wait for the download to install. Once its done, you should see the download or install option appear. You should be able to type “Madden 19 New Superstar Edition for Android” or “Madden 19 New Superstar Edition for iOS” into the box.<br>
</p>
<p>Go back to the mobile app, select the Madden 19 mobile app version that you want, and hit “Purchase”.</p>
<p>As this download is free, you should need a credit or debit card to purchase it. This makes it feel a little bit more like a purchase.</p>
<p>
Once the download has completed, you’ll have access to the game.<br>
Hey, have you seen anyone doing this?<br>
If you haven’t had it yet, go check out the game – it’s freaking neat!<br>
</p>
