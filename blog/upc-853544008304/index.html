I was a class A student who wanted to become an astronaut. I had aspirations to become an astronaut if I could become a student of a university who introduced me to the kind of programme that I eventually choose to pursue with the love and dedication of a dedicated husband.
Fantastic people, remarkable projects, and inspiring events have convinced me that this is what I am meant for.">

<p>I was a class A student who wanted to become an astronaut. I had aspirations to become an astronaut if I could become a student of a university who introduced me to the kind of programme that I eventually choose to pursue with the love and dedication of a dedicated husband.</p>
<p>Fantastic people, remarkable projects, and inspiring events have convinced me that this is what I am meant for.</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when my kids will look back in my memory and they will say &amp;quot;I took that day to go with you.&amp;quot; Their expressions of joy and pride from their growing up years will prove that they heard about an opportunity they were born into that opened door to a different world of possibilities and a different world within them.</p>
<p>It is not for the faint hearted or the indecisive.</p>
<p>The day I left Kishore with full of confidence and love for life, and a growing feeling of responsibility which has driven me to prove to myself and others who I am, are those stories that will be heard when you hold one of my babies in your hands.</p>
<p>
Your story gives meaning to everyone it has touched, hope to everyone and the courage to rise above all adversity.<br>
There is strength in everyone and no matter what lies ahead, you shine.<br>
