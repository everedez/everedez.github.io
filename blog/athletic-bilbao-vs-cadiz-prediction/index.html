If you think as Athletic Bilbao does you are quite soon mistaken with them. The Basque club lost several of their key players in a disaster and are probably a Premier League club in the future. Is that their best road to a success or would Athletic be better than any club?
The reasons behind the former being true are well known.">

<p>If you think as Athletic Bilbao does you are quite soon mistaken with them. The Basque club lost several of their key players in a disaster and are probably a Premier League club in the future. Is that their best road to a success or would Athletic be better than any club?</p>
<p>The reasons behind the former being true are well known. Recent months were a black hole when most of the players were not even part of the squad due to suspension or injury. But the idea that it could happen again and some of the players affected maybe even suffered serious injury, this is the real sign of a poor mentality.</p>
<p>As such, with high wages they have the opportunity to score plenty of points and impress crowds. However, this is only a faint hope with the transfer ban and they were severely hit by the new laws.</p>

<p>If you take in the recent fixtures the team has a great potential and may still have it. Nevertheless, the main problem is that the squad is not there to fulfill the hype and it is, unfortunately, without creativity.</p>
<p>What we can see is a team that has sacrificed personnel for goals. It is hard to measure and therefore also hard to predict their path. But it is clear they have to play well to recover, because if they are a real threat players do not adapt fast.</p>
<p>Cars cannot play together in the last place in the championship: &amp;quot;Football&amp;quot;.</p>
