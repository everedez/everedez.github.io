Are the seeds of human destruction ever so thoroughly planted within the folds and paths of Time? Let the seeds be planted now, one year at a time, and the seeds grow for a hundred years.

<p>Are the seeds of human destruction ever so thoroughly planted within the folds and paths of Time? Let the seeds be planted now, one year at a time, and the seeds grow for a hundred years.</p>
<p>
By Chance<br>
The long history of mankind is a history of random events, not chance,<br>
as the tree of life shows,<br>
This tree is the One<br>
</p>
<p>Man - the center of all things - should not be forgotten, and the man within, the center of all things, this man should not be forgotten,</p>
<p>
This is not good,<br>
This is not good,<br>
This the One<br>
</p>
<p>Are the seeds of human destruction ever so thoroughly planted within the folds and paths of Time? Let the seeds be planted now, one year at a time, and the seeds grow for a hundred years.</p>
<p>
This should not be the case.<br>
This is not good.<br>
Nemesis<br>
</p>
<p>&amp;quot;What do you expect from him that will kill all the women in the world? Even if he takes out the whole of India or his whole empire he will still kill all the women in the world. The whole world is still alive. He is the one.&amp;quot;</p>
<h2>Nuclear War</h2>
<p>The worst disasters and catastrophes in human history do not occur at random, and there are, therefore no random factors in the history of man. Every disaster has a human element,</p>
<p>
this is particularly the case, and this is the key to survival of man in disaster.<br>
This is not good.<br>
Heresy<br>
This man still believes in reincarnation,<br>
but this is not good.<br>
Cosmic Collapse, Black Holes, and<br>
Supernovae<br>
</p>
<p>The forces of Nature are quite unbalanced, and the extremes of which Nature is capable have now reached such heights and depths that the state of imbalance cannot be reversed. You will find these extremes in many places throughout the Universe.</p>
<p>The future is not up to us, only the present.</p>
