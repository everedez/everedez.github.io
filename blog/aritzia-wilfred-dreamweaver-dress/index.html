<h1>Aritzia Wilfred Dreamweaver Dress</h1>
<p>Aritzia Wilfred is one of the most charismatic artists of our time. She always builds something special, never compromises on it. I am myself one of Wilfred&amp;#x27;s fans, always moving with my heart in the same place, never settling for anything but the best. That beauty that arrives into our life with utmost pride, I would say, &amp;quot;Aritzia Wilfred dress&amp;quot;.</p>

<p>I have recently been impressed by Aritzia and her wonderful sense of style. Her dress was an integral part of my December 2016 Cosplay blog post at COSPLAYPOOL, you can read that post to find out how fun, beautiful and adorable Aritzia Dress has been for me for this year&amp;#x27;s Cosplay Blog theme. On top of that I actually have to admit it&amp;#x27;s pretty awesome out of the way you can come together to create something that has the love and support of Aritzia and her wonderful team.</p>
<h2>Aritzia Wilfred Dress</h2>
<p>A little more information on this great work of Aritzia Wilfred.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s a Gown. I love the fact that the fabric is as lightweight as possible. The fabric even feels like silk but it feels actually very lightweight. The reason I say so, is because of the gorgeous gold shade that you can see in my Cosplay Blog photo below.</p>
<p>The name Aritzia is written on the fabric with a pale pink ink. Because of this bold title, it&amp;#x27;s an epitome of luxury and sophistication. The dress looks great on the wearer&amp;#x27;s back. The fabric is so light it has more elasticity than mecha suits. She is also covered with a wide collar with a plunging skirt. I like how she avoided the curves just as the woman, who walks down the street without a care in the world. The best part of all is the fabulous and very stylish crown. What impressed me most is the fact that everything is done by hand and all embroidered. There are embroideries throughout the fabric and the detailed colors that you can see on the sides of the dress also deserve much more praise.</p>
