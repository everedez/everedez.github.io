<h1>Anthology Of American Folk Music, Vol. 1-3</h1>
<p>Here&amp;#x27;s a small collection of folk recordings from the 1920s, before they became popular as country (or rock) bands, but still remains popular. Since that&amp;#x27;s true, I&amp;#x27;m going to call this collection Folkworks Not for Sale. The earliest recordings are full-length records, with a few non-album tracks (for a better quality of sound), with a few vocal demos, plus a few rare bits of original material, such as a re-mix of &amp;quot;On The Wires&amp;quot; by Ted Hardy (you may find it on my site) and interviews with many of the musicians I cover in this release.</p>
<p>How it Works</p>
<p>Listen to songs by or about the artists you love.</p>
<p>There are 15 tracks per album, 15 to count for the CDs. As I lay out the list, a field is created below each listed album name and is filled in by each artist name after it. If you don&amp;#x27;t see the artist you are looking for, just cross your fingers for the one that actually shows up on the list. Here&amp;#x27;s the look after the field is filled in:</p>
<p>
The list, just in!<br>
* Track names used on CD labels<br>
Last: Just Got Started<br>
First: I&amp;#x27;m Pretty Glad<br>
Second: A-One<br>
Third: Find My Good Girl<br>
Fourth: I Got Another One<br>
Fifth: Worlda Go<br>
Sixth: A Time To Sing<br>
Seventh: On The Wires<br>
Eighth: Green Mill<br>
Last: Gotta Woman (The Graces)<br>
First: Come Around<br>
Second: Worlda Go<br>
Third: Find My Good Girl<br>
Fourth: A World Without You<br>
Fifth: Find My Good Girl<br>
* Track names are edited<br>
The titles have been completely re-digitized. All listings are presented here in romanized order.<br>
</p>
<p>The full tracks are:</p>
<p>Album track titles are left in the romanized, chronological order of the album/s. The album info is included below.</p>
<p>This list is not yet done. Any corrections, additions, or comments are welcomed. However, to quickly review the list: The first few entries are mine. If you know a great song not included and you live close enough, I&amp;#x27;ll appreciate it if you send it to me! There will be times where the correct album file is simply missing for an album, but not to worry, I&amp;#x27;ll come across it.</p>
