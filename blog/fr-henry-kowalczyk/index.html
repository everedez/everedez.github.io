<h1>Fr Henry Kowalczyk</h1>
<p>Sir Arthur Stanley Pembroke, 1st Viscount Pembroke, K.B.B.E., second son of Edward Pembroke, 7th Earl of Pembroke, by his fifth wife and only daughter Helen, daughter of Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland. He was born on November 9 or 10, 1783 in Paris, France, the son of Edward Pembroke, by his fifth wife, Lady Helen Ogg. Edward Pembroke and Lady Helen, were married in 1776 and both of them arrived in England on June 19 or 20, 1776 as a political refugees in the custody of The Queen&amp;#x27;s Lieutenant, Sir Arthur Stanley Pembroke, K.B.B.E.; &amp;#x27;The Queen&amp;#x27;s Lieutenant&amp;#x27; of the night of July 25 - or &amp;#x27;38&amp;#x27;, to be precise. In fact it was July 6, 1776 when the Empress Maria Theresa signed the Treaty of Westphalia, confirming England and her allies as allies of the Habsburgs against France. The Queen&amp;#x27;s Lieutenant, Sir Arthur Stanley Pembroke, and his wives who arrived with them, arrived three days before Pembroke&amp;#x27;s arrival in London. Pembroke&amp;#x27;s father, the 7th Earl, died when he was a little boy. Lady Helen died at the early age of nineteen while still a young girl, perhaps because she was not related to the Pembroke family. Lady Helen had fallen in love with Count Bernstorff and married him; however, being the third child, she was not related to the family; but this claim of hers was not approved by her parents, Edward Pembroke and Henry Clifford. She was a lovely woman, but she was ungovernable, and she was somewhat different from ordinary English peasant women of her day. She was extremely untidy and appeared to have, an Irish type of accent. She had blond hair and a large mouth and her complexion and appearance were not so attractive as her cousin, the Duke of Cumberland was beautiful. With this in mind, Henry Clifford offered Pembroke an annuity of Â£2000 a year, in January of 1777, and confirmed him as the heir to the throne of England.</p>
