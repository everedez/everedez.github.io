<h1>Holtsville Hal 2023</h1>
<p>The area that is home to the city of Haltsville is being re-designated as a Federal Recreational Areas by the US Department of Interior for the purpose of ensuring safe recreational activities in addition to providing recreational and environmental protection. This area contains significant national land resources. These include a handful of state lands and several private land parcels. The area is noted for its &amp;quot;wonderful opportunities for the recreational traveler to visit and study in the area.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The total area of land that is within the Recreational Use Area for the city of Haltsville includes 522.35 acres of state conservation land, 139.17 acres of state and one non-attached federal land parcel, and 13.37 acres of private land.</p>
<p>The Recreational Use Area boundaries are overlaid by green lines. The National Weather Service forecasts and management information identifies over one million acres within an R-U of 40-plus inches of snow. In addition, the area near the NE boundary south of Highway 141 has over four percent inches of moisture.</p>
<p>North of the recreation area, the Mississippi River is the border of the city of Haltsville from N to W and E. This river is approximately 35 miles long and has a very high water table depth. A lot of this river&amp;#x27;s water is subject to being redirected by levees in the area. The river begins in a group of islands called the Barataria Bluffs that are approximately 20 to 35 miles south of the city of Haltsville, through them to the Mississippi River, then north, and south at that point. The Mississippi River is also separated from another much larger river by several lakes in the surrounding region and is about 215 miles long.</p>
<p>Visitors should be aware that two serious risk factors exist for attempting a fatal kayak or canoe accident along the Mississippi River at a depth of more than 3,000 feet and where an iceberg is present in its waters.</p>
<h2>Michele &amp;amp; Kenneth Breslin</h2>
<p>Michele and Kenneth joined the M&amp;amp;K RV Group in 2005. In 2012, they sold their company, “The M&amp;amp;K” to their sons, Robert “Bret” and Anthony “Bret” Breslin.</p>
