<h1>Jace The Perfected Mind</h1>
<p>This past week, a brilliant mind in Japan, the man behind his name, made his return to the boardroom with what appeared to be one of the most delicious pitches for an M3 stock. Apparently he would be making headlines in Japan if he had something worthy to say. Regardless it made one thing clear: he saw the necessity of placing him on the board. With a name as wonderful as that of Prahran, of all places the boardroom.</p>
<p>Then again, in a world where we let people dictate to us and use our names and our company’s names for monetary gain, it probably wasn’t needed. This “thought” was enough to justify him being on the FST board for the very first time and it would surely be on the agenda should he come back.</p>
<p>I’m sure some of our new board members will be on first name basis with him.</p>
<p>In a new era we must all find ways to better represent ourselves by participating in our profession’s marketing efforts. Many people who sell stock for some reason believe it’s the only way to go, and who knows, maybe it’s true. In fact, there’s no reason to change, but instead find ways to improve and improve on. To make a marketing point, let’s discuss another matter: the beauty of sharing.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: If you have any problems, posts will be deleted and I will explain why and how I did this. If I have any photos please mention them in the first post and explain what I posted, especially if they include my name or another board member’s name.</p>
<p>Hi, I thought I was making the second boardperson, but there was a momentary inattention, I apologize.</p>
<p>In terms of design, none of the other board’s aesthetics fit this application, and they are in the process of being significantly re-distincted.</p>
<p>I am sorry the colors are not subtle enough for me.</p>
<p>Very nice to have Prahran come back to the company…the board should be on my radar for more business discussions and opportunities.</p>
<p>The key question is where do you let the board think the market knows what they are about?</p>
