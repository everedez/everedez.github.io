<h1>Meanwhile In Florida Memes</h1>
<p>In 2013, the top 10 memes during the first 3 months of the year each received more than 800,000 views, as determined by a social media data platform called &amp;quot;Daily Meme Generator.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The top memes of 2013 were as follows:</p>
<h2>1. &amp;quot;F--- Donald Trump!&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>For the first time ever, Donald Trump was not the President of the United States.</p>
<p>The meme which played throughout the day on Twitter was directed at Hillary Clinton, who, during her presidential campaign, was involved in multiple scandals, such as:</p>
<h2>F--- Donald Trump!</h2>
<p>This meme is about how Trump was a jerk to Fox News host Jesse Watters, a Republican presidential candidate, who was a big supporter of Trump during a segment on January 26, 2015 called &amp;quot;5 Dirty cops in Hollywood,&amp;quot; and how that scene put Fox&amp;#x27;s main contributor on the spot.</p>
<p>
2. It was created by the &amp;quot;Daily Meme Generator&amp;quot;<br>
In other words, it was created by the same group of people behind the &amp;quot;Greatest Hits&amp;quot; series that created &amp;quot;T.O.R.I.B.&amp;quot;<br>
3. &amp;quot;Spotted a fake&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>Why this particular meme has been recognized is beyond me (and most of the videos&amp;#x27; creator&amp;#x27;s), but presumably its creator saw it, guessed at its existence (it was so close to the end of the presidential run that it would have earned full credit as being a &amp;quot;meme&amp;quot; had it played) and just thought, &amp;quot;hey, this is pretty.&amp;quot;</p>
<h2>4. &amp;quot;Fake Donald Trump&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>He actually turned out to be fake, the jokes on both coasts were kind of weak, and his business has also been beset with scandal.</p>
<h2>5. &amp;quot;G.W. Bush&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>
This was one of many campaigns during the 2000 campaign which both parties ended up supporting.<br>
Also, this may have been done by the same people as the &amp;quot;Fox News Girl&amp;quot; campaign.<br>
6. &amp;quot;The Donofix&amp;quot;<br>
Who knew that Donald Trump actually had a son named Donald Trump?<br>
</p>
<h2>7. &amp;quot;J.F.K. Preetsex&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>9 of the worst quotes ever recorded</p>
<p>10.</p>
