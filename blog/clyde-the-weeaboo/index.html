<h2>History</h2>
<p>Weeaboos are a huge family of entertainers who took to the stage in the early 1960s. With a new generation becoming hard pressed to find quality music, they stayed true to the origins of a long standing, in demand characterised by a deep and energetic vocal with a tendency to use the word &amp;#x27;wee&amp;#x27; rather than the actual meaning of the word &amp;#x27;geese&amp;#x27;. Weeaboos have come a long way since 1960 and it&amp;#x27;s only now where it is no longer necessary to make specialised dance tracks to be considered a classic, it&amp;#x27;s enough to just simply be a Great Train Robber!</p>

Early history<br>
</p>
<p>Weeaboos existed in the early 1960s, but were probably best known through television. The more well known of their names are David Kent or Donald McNeill, but from 1960 to 1965 the titular Weeaboo was described by the BBC&amp;#x27;s Paul &amp;quot;Chas&amp;quot; Wells as &amp;quot;One of the first icons of the 1970s&amp;quot;. These characters appeared on their early incarnations (including their name change) in an early incarnation on the same network, first on Coronation Street in the 1970s. After being the featured team for fifteen years, were also the namesake of television&amp;#x27;s longest running drama series, he became the last presenter of the programme - following the departure of Christopher Cleal and Stuart Ross in 2007.[1] These Weeaboos have often been included on the Late Late Show or the Daily It programmes, becoming something of a cult following after their first appearances on the silver screen in 1964-5 (they both reprised their role at the end of their time on Early Music in 1970). They have also been one of the highlights of many nostalgia fests of the late 1970s and 1980s, enjoying the greatest ratings growth of any band in the long running &amp;#x27;Back To The 90&amp;#x27; contest.[6] In 1970, he told a BBC radio audience that he &amp;quot;dreamed of becoming a musician as a teenager&amp;quot;.[7]</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s, all Weeaboos were members or contestants on the BBC Television series At Home With the Weeaboos.</p>
