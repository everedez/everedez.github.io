<p>: Abracadabra! This guide will cover some of the best and simplest Abrackadabra configurations you can use to take advantage of some awesome features in Pokemon! The Abracadabra Guide series will mostly be a walk through the early Pokemon games with the aim to help people get started quickly and easily. This guide will try my level of best for all types of players, and if you like the results of my first Abracadabra guide, I am sure you will want to up the ante from there so we can do as much or as little as possible to get a great result.</p>
<p>If you are new to Pokemon and want to dive in head first and easily pick up a tutorial guide like this quickly, I recommend you get a Pokémon GO account or at least try it out! If you aren&amp;#x27;t using the app yet, you can check out the official beginner guide here!</p>
<p>What is Abracadabra?</p>
<p>Abracadabra is a high level attack that comes in your pokémon encounter which is usually spread throughout all of the starter mons of the generation, Pokemon League, and any other previous or current games that you have played in, including Pokemon Red and Green.</p>
<p>These attacks are powerful and involve some kind of physical interaction with your opponent, which lets&amp;#x27;s us throw into attack some one-hit kills which can only happen once a certain specific combination is used. Additionally, if you&amp;#x27;ve ever been to Pokemon League you will remember which of the two mons your opponent is able to hold onto, like the Pokemon Blue mons or the Pikachu, which lets you cancel out attacks you may have otherwise used.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if you are able to do one, or in some cases even two, Abracadabra can also allow your opponent to spam that attack all over the field, or possibly even burn their opponents in attacks that they were otherwise probably unlikely to be able to do.</p>
<p>How to use an Abracadabra / Abracks</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to use an Abracadabra / Abracks, but we want to cover them quickly so we can allow you both a set up for success and to have a little fun with it for us.</p>
