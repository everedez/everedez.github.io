<h1>Ned Beatty Teeth Deliverance</h1>
<h3>E-mail Author</h3>
<p>On the 25th October the little boy was taking out his shed shed and being carried about back of his cottage. Next moment the door of the shed was thrown open and in rushed the big sister teddy bear jumping out. “Hi,” she said to the little boy. “How’d you get here, dear?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I fell in the pond” said the little boy politely.</p>
<p>The big sister then proceeded to bare bear detail, saying who made the children and what had happened to their little friends.</p>
<p>
“Why, you didn’t climb in this water tank and cut your thumb, did you?” she asked.<br>
“No,” said the little boy.<br>
“I don’t understand why you’re here,” she said. “You don’t have any place to go.”<br>
</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s alright” said the little boy. “Somewhere where I can play. I can play in the water.”</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t play until that little dog of a teddy bear is here with you. Don’t you be fooling about after leaving the house.”</p>
<p>“The dog? He went back?” the little boy asked. “Please stay. I don’t have anything else but my dog. I’ll do anything you say.”</p>
<p>“And that little girl?” The big sister asked, “Not her? You don’t like her, do you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no,” said the little boy. “She was just an doll.”</p>
<p>“Well! She wants to play with you, ” said the big sister. “Go get her. I’ll be up here when she gets here and she can play by herself.”</p>
<p>“Tell her I play by myself,” said the little boy.</p>
<p>“No,” yelled the big sister. “Take yourself away.</p>
