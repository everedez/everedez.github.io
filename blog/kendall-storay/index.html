<h2>Personal Quotes:</h2>
<p>
• &amp;quot;Although my influences and tutoring have been limited, I have made tremendous academic progress toward becoming a great classicist.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve done some of the best abstract types, and I have a little piece that I&amp;#x27;m working on.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve been teaching art for eighteen years, and there has never been a day when I did not use the value of the thing that I was using.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;I would say that being in an art department at all is a stepping-stone to being in any department at all.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;This kind of obsession with drawing is unlike most disciplines. There is a reason why much of the art historical literature says that this kind of draw is essentially non-significant. There is great history and scholarship in the study of drawing. It&amp;#x27;s not about the drawing of figures of non-minimal significance. There is a great deal in drawing of the vanishing points, the things that you get closest to your eyes and the things that you leave out.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;Dada was all about working outside of a prescribed program. What Artaud said, in terms of making the work of art you can comprehend, is true. Once somebody approaches it, it&amp;#x27;s really hard and rigorous.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m not a spiritual person, and I don&amp;#x27;t try to be. This is not religious; it&amp;#x27;s about being in contact with reality.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;When I was a kid, I was fascinated by the idea of the devil. The devil was like a walking blackboard that you could eat your lunch on. I always had a visual reference for that in my mind.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;I don&amp;#x27;t know a very few artists. I know maybe five.&amp;quot;<br>
• &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s an intrinsic knowledge that you&amp;#x27;re saying there shouldn&amp;#x27;t be any value in living. All art is a value.<br>
