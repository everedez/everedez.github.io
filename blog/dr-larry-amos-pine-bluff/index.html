The Pine Family - Their Ancestry is being Revealed<br>
With the early 1890s, the Pine Coons - Thomas and Jervis<br>
- came together, becoming the Pine Family - now is being revealed<br>
The Pine Family<br>
The Pine Brothers - Their Origin<br>
</p>
<p>The Pine Coons, Thomas W. Pine and his son James T. Pine - came together in 1874 in Illinois, a small town called Edwardsville. The men became friendly, and sometimes worked together to collect</p>
<p>
trees to later use to build the first Pine House near<br>
McCarville. By the time of the sale in 1896, the Pine<br>
House was at 300 Main Street in Edwardsville. Because<br>
the Pine House was very rural and lacking in<br>
amenities, the Pine Brothers used to live at 128<br>
Eaton Street until 1890.<br>
The Pine Family - Their Ancestry<br>

time the house was at 300 Main Street.<br>

All of the Pine Brothers had to agree, so they agreed that one<br>
belonged to the family, but not all the family did. They were not<br>
all related as the family of Pine Coons had many branches of<br>
different colors and origins. The children of the Pine<br>
Brothers<br>
are well suited to the task<br>
to learn how to produce the fine quality of cedar as part of the<br>
larger collection of Pine Trees for a private home. Two large<br>
woods, two great deal, and several smaller trees were all bought from the brother of the Pine Brothers in 1860. The<br>
larger wood was purchased by John Hamilton, and then Henry Linder<br>
of Elmwood. The smallest wood was also purchased by John Hamilton and Henry Linder, and they purchased<br>
other wood from different sources.<br>
During 1860 and 1861 the brothers were at home a<br>
portion of the time. After 1860 and 1861, the pine trees needed<br>
plowing, or they fell too long ago and never were planted back in the<br>
natural state.<br>
