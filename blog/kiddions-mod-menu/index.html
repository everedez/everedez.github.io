Worst Writing I&amp;#x27;ve Ever Read
Getting A Craft
If you are new to the blogs, you might notice by now there are things that I&amp;#x27;m not always talking about. I was still writing there just last week and I had a bad case of writer-itis. I&amp;#x27;m going to try to bring a little heart with my posts because anything that comes up I am always trying to avoid.">

Worst Writing I&amp;#x27;ve Ever Read<br>
Getting A Craft<br>
</p>
<p>If you are new to the blogs, you might notice by now there are things that I&amp;#x27;m not always talking about. I was still writing there just last week and I had a bad case of writer-itis. I&amp;#x27;m going to try to bring a little heart with my posts because anything that comes up I am always trying to avoid. This, I am trying to work on over the summer so I have a bit more time to do it.</p>
<p>Now that I am a crafter, I like to do the very same things that you do. A couple things I work on are my own books which is keeping me, the youngest crafter in the band, busy. My first book is coming out soon and I have put a lot of time in on that book. My second is a tea towel set with one for mom and I. I am really good at designing and my brother-in-law, Jason, is super talented. I am also making myself do some tatting here which I have not done before. I like to study and it always helps me to keep at it. I like to experiment with my ideas and to see what I can come up with to tweak it before I cast it. I like the concept of doing things just because they are fun and challenging. The first thing that is getting my gears turning is updating the blogs. As much as I would like to have everything done in one fell swoop, I am doing it. I think its just going to take me some time to be able to find all of the spaces I need to organize the blogs and everything else. The rest of my time right now is trying to craft to keep me distracted while I have to work on projects to keep my own projects moving along. We all know it takes time. The idea here is to just keep on doing the things that I am doing. I intend to do this all while I have a job. There are a ton of things I could be doing which I have put off as long as I have. I think its going to be my normal for the next six months.</p>
<p>The rest is catching up. I want to make cards again and get my stuff together. I&amp;#x27;m having to up my workload pretty often that I know.</p>
<p>I have a few projects planned this week.</p>
