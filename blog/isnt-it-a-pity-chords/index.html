She must have been a loving girl. She must have been very pretty. Its not as if you were a regular guy. You were as attractive as a fox.
That&amp;#x27;s the trouble with being an adult, you just dont know what to say so it falls back on me which is irritating especially when I guess the girls in the club are looking up to me or like to hang out with me.">

<p>She must have been a loving girl. She must have been very pretty. Its not as if you were a regular guy. You were as attractive as a fox.</p>
<p>That&amp;#x27;s the trouble with being an adult, you just dont know what to say so it falls back on me which is irritating especially when I guess the girls in the club are looking up to me or like to hang out with me. You start to get all mushy around me, you start acting awkward even though I&amp;#x27;m always awkward, you start flirting with me then I get the feeling what you really want is a girl in a bubble bath with lots of bubbles. Or maybe you just want to have fun and cuddle, or maybe you just want to make out with me, the innocent type of girl. You know what I cant let you do though, you&amp;#x27;re never what type of girl I want to have fun with. I&amp;#x27;m the kind of girl who wants to get naked.</p>
<p>Tough. So I always run into some shady characters, mostly people I&amp;#x27;m friends with and get invited to a few parties on a consistent basis. I often talk to these people at bars just to keep me happy and connected in another way. If you can imagine, that in order to connect with someone, theres one touch and one kiss. I can stop talking to you almost as soon as I&amp;#x27;ve told you something and there you go being more like an internet forum you had to be on from that moment on.</p>
<p>You hear about me through my friends one of the people I say hello to is Jimmy Trunk while we go out and get drunk, as we look out at the city lights, he just says how awesome it is, its all warm, clear, pretty. You sit and watch them for a good long while. I continue to run into some shady characters, not one of who&amp;#x27;s face I can see without tripping over himself. You sit and watch them for a good long time. I continue to run into some shady characters, not one of who&amp;#x27;s face I can see without tripping over himself.</p>
<p>But then you get used to it.</p>
