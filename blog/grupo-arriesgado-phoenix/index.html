<h1>Grupo Arriesgado Phoenix</h1>
<p>Grupo Arriesgado Phoenix had a stellar 2016, culminating with their $190,000 winat UFC 187 in 2017 and the win against Anderson Silva at Fight Night in Las Vegas. They impressed in their promotional debut in July before unleashing the most potent combination that Arriesgado has found, the Chaku-Uga. The following month, they went 4-0, an impressive streak for a female MMA fighter.</p>
<p>A month later, Team Alpha Male had finally made up losses in their three fights: Briana Land (UFC 186), Lexie Frost (UFC 181) and Miesha Tate (UFC 194).</p>
<p>As May ended, Arriesgado faced a woman they had expected would start their third journey into the UFC against the previously unbeaten Joanna Jedrzejczyk. At the time, the only woman to fight in the UFC at welterweight was Cat Zingano, but she has since become Bellator’s newly appointed lightweight champion and is fighting for the world title for the first time. Arriesgado, on the other hand, has had the lead and the plan going into the fight.</p>
<p>It was all for the best. The win earned Arriesgado a trip to the UFC vs. Titan FC bantamweight championship fight to face Dana White, Chael Sonnen and Wanderlei Silva. The battle ended in an unanimous decision, although the majority of MMA fans’ views saw the battle. This might have had something to do with the fact both women were wrestling, but it was quickly forgotten soon after, although this is not a normal fight between these two kickboxers.</p>
<p>The UFC vs. Titan FC bantamweight championship fight ended with the best brawl of the year, with both camps crying out for the blood of the competitors. And Arriesgado was in there.</p>
<p>No, not necessarily in her head after the fight, but in her body.</p>
<p>After going for a single leg choke on Zingano, Arriesgado held the rear take down on Arreola – a submission of sorts, forcing her to use her elbows. She then took out bothwomen in quick succession – a combination Arriesgado loved, but struggled against in previous fights.</p>
