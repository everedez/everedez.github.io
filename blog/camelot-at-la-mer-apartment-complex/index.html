<h1>Camelot At La Mer Apartment Complex</h1>
<p>Perched on the edge of one of Kuwait City’s most gorgeous parks sits one of the highest-end apartments in the UK: La Mer complex. Located on the eighth green field of the old city (we’re referring to all the green grass, and the brown grass, and a part of red). Not exactly what you’d see parked in front of your neighbour’s TV window in a full-scale block of concrete and glass.</p>
<p>But nonetheless.</p>
<p>Rightfully, we couldn’t resist posting our favourite part about the latest ground-breaking ‘living room’ in the neighbourhood: the arched, high-end terrace, hung with Christmas lights, which spreads at the front of the building. Many of us found the whole setup and decor aesthetically stunning. And we were ecstatic to see such a panoramic terrace and the glass roof in the middle of it. Hooray!</p>
<p>The ‘at the end of the street’ was perhaps a bit too far (actually it was in the far distance, and we missed some of our neighbours) but the roof terrace was pretty much the only part of the roof exposed to the sun all day. Here, instead of a patio that disappears when you come out of the restaurant, the patio was as far as you could get. I was pretty much enjoying my afternoon sun when I glanced up – and saw that something was coming. Now, I know you’re thinking, so what? The terrace is called La Mer? Why is it called La Mer? How is it ‘La Mer’? You’re probably wondering the same about the patio that you didn’t notice. The patio has a pretty long story to tell.</p>
<p>Which, I think, can be good and bad. In any given situation, it can be a nice thing (in fact, the most interesting thing about the terrace was the view of Dubai and the nearby desert). Or it can be, well, useless.</p>
<p>Take it with a pinch of salt. The patio wasn’t bad, at least. And maybe because it is what it is, it’s very handy in a cool breeze.</p>
<p>But what was the patio for, and why does it have the namewhere?</p>
