<h1>Toya Boudy Cookbook</h1>
<p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of the book that started it all.</p>
<p>And another new Toya Boudy book.</p>
<p>I may be a few chapters past the official publication date as I&amp;#x27;ve been away from a keyboard and my Kindle for a few years, but this is one of those books that has stayed with me after all these years. In the middle of the book I often turn to Toya Boudy, who seems to be keeping a great deal of the &amp;quot;golden&amp;quot; work of the early years that are too many to count.</p>
<p>Whether it be an old recipe, a new contribution or a discussion that you have had with your Boudy family, this book is sure to be a winner in your cooking. There&amp;#x27;s my personal Boudy Cookbook of 2013, which is complete with step-by-step photos, a &amp;quot;Boudy Classic Box&amp;quot;, and some dishes that are Boudy classics that still stand up today. And of course it&amp;#x27;s a cooking-class recipes book. Which means you can&amp;#x27;t pass this one up.</p>
<p>Speaking of great recipes, I am very excited to announce that the newest addition to the Boudy family is the much loved Boudy book! The first official (and much loved) cookbook by one the food porn pioneers (with an unearned edge).</p>
<h2>THE GOURMET IS THE ANIME</h2>
<p>I&amp;#x27;ve written other reviews over time about The Gourmet that are well worth a read though not as long as the Boudy book, but it&amp;#x27;s one of those recipes that I really want to be a part of a new generation of I hope by many in here.</p>
<p>Instead of going into a recipe more often, I wanted to talk about the whole premise of this post: I want to eat THE GOURMET IS THE ANIME FOR LIFE - and every delicious meal including (possibly) vegan burek.</p>
<p>So, first here&amp;#x27;s what the book has to offer.</p>
<p>Vegan, Almond Crisps: Take 10 almonds, scoop one-third of the nut mixture from each almond and place in a bowl. Stir in ½ cup oats, 1 teaspoon peanut butter, ¼ cup butter, 2 cups ice cubes, 1 cup sesame seeds and a pinch of salt. Transfer to a freezer bag and freeze for 3 hours.</p>
