<h3>My Thoughts On “The Last Guardian” ‘s Original Trailer:</h3>
<p>I was shocked by the original trailer of the original Guardian Of Light and the news that the game’s designers were not allowed to attend E3 in order to promote the game at all!</p>
<p>It truly was a breath of fresh air to have the team showing off a game by themselves who can work together to create something they themselves want to create and spend less time setting up a conference full of people trying to gather news and advertise in hopes that the press will pay attention to what they are actually trying to create. To have your best product debut one person’s vision and another person have an opportunity to see it for themselves!</p>
<p>It was also refreshing to actually be able to see and spend the weekend with the developers themselves. It would have been nice if all the press had gone to WonderCon in Houston or San Jose, but they did make it back from Los Angeles, so credit where its due that at least the press was able to see the developer and have a fun conversation with them.</p>
<p>The official info on the game seems to be even more vague today and I hope we are not going to get a re-release and re-releases of everything we already know.</p>
<p>Why we are not told if we are actually controlling Riley Fenlock:</p>
<p>We haven’t quite gotten confirmation of a feature that we were told we would be able to control Finn’s gender, let alone that we would be able to pilot a fully controllable character. It is still “Early-access” and unannounced and we understand the team is still figuring out some of the details.</p>
<p>We were told that we would have to give up all our weapon handling abilities, such as being able to “get” every single energy drink we pick up or be able to store up to 10 health packs (because this trailer was released and we’ve heard this might expand the game’s Universe on how many lives we have so far). Then again, it is a three tiered system with all of our own skills that we are not controlling and in which we are not able to use. Apparently, if you hand me a drink and try to pull me up, you might lose a life and then be able to “get” it back to me.</p>
