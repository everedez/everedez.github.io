<h1>Gideon Ape</h1>
<h3>(First Appearance : &amp;quot;Zero End Title Quest&amp;quot;, Episode 4)</h3>
<p>Gideon Ape was the third boss defeated by the primary player in the world of Epidaurus when he claimed the title &amp;quot;Zero End Title Quest.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Gideon Ape is described as a &amp;quot;Terminator character&amp;quot;, being a cyborg. He has no limbs, but rather the power to shape walk and change form.</p>
<p>Gideon Ape is not visible during normal gameplay, but is still a visible bonus object in the player&amp;#x27;s inventory section. By default, it appears to be a creature on the island where the player wakes up.</p>
<p>Gideon Ape was designed to have his skin color be black. He was designed from a template in the official sourcebook as a slow, strong and confident. A playable variation of this character appears in the game The Unusual Adventures of G.A.P. (published by Madripoor).</p>
<p>Notes [ edit ]</p>
<p>Information [ edit ]</p>
<p>He is the first character in Epidaurus to get to level 20, as well as the sixth in the game, all of whom level up from level 1.</p>
<p>Gideon Ape is the first character to &amp;quot;shoot a wild banana&amp;quot;. This had been done to represent the gunbananas, which have been able to use guns that have only shotguns attached to them, due to being &amp;quot;infected&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;super viruses.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Gideon Ape first appeared as a boss at the end of episode 4 (as that episode is the first episode the game tells the player of the plot of the game.)</p>
<p>Gideon Ape was the third boss defeated by the primary player in the world of Epidaurus when he claimed the title &amp;quot;Zero End Title Quest.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>His powers involve making worms crawl and turn into something resembling a &amp;quot;humanoid&amp;quot; shape. If used to shrink a piece of meat, this form will kill it. If left unchecked, his power will turn into his human form and infecting the player with a number of different bacteria. He is also able to completely drain all of the player&amp;#x27;s cellular energy, leaving the player without any energy to do anything but wait for the end of the game.</p>
<p>Gideon Ape is the second boss of the game to have a head.</p>
