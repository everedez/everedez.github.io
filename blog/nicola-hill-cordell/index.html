<h1>Nicola Hill-cordell</h1>
<h3>Selected Publications</h3>
<p>Since 1985, I have published a number of books dealing with spiritual growth and my personal philosophy. They involve practical advice, along with humor and deep insight for finding your identity and increasing inner peace. If you would like to read these books and receive information about them, please send me an e-mail. I love to quote writers such as Albert Einstein and Harry Henry Miller, among many others.</p>
<h2>Spiritual Education</h2>
<p>Focusing on Higher Education: A Systematic Way of Acquiring a Self-Assessment.</p>
<p>I realize that some people have difficulties or at best, an unhealthy reaction to receiving an education. I share my experience with you, because I know that many people dealing with challenges around college and career know this process. I am not going to predict what college or career path will become for you and I respect the decisions you make, not least your value for working hard and staying focused in your chosen path.</p>
<p>The goal of this book is to set you on a path that is challenging, yet not so challenging as to be insurmountable. The journey is not over, and we’ll get there. Along the way, we’ll address the questions that anyone who has gone this way (a journey that few people are likely to be able to complete) would like to discuss. I don’t think anyone in their right mind can really say how much they would learn from attending college, although I know that I’ve had the opportunity and encouragement to question the knowledge and values I’ve been taught. By offering specifics on the questions we raise in each chapter and in each section, I hope to open your minds to possible answers, whether based on fact, or whether based off of our own experience or what we see in the news.</p>
<p>Because the path we are working through here, which I call the Pathway of Self-Assessment, is a basic foundation of how a student will eventually operate out in reality, I am also sharing how it works on our lives in the real world: to turn our minds from what exists in our minds to what is in the reality out in our lives right now. I am also taking away the temptation to “fly” into the future to escape reality, looking for more knowledge while staying trapped in what we are and doing.</p>
