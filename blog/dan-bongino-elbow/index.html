<h1>Dan Bongino Elbow</h1>
<p>Who is Vin Diesel, and why is he connected with the horror-comedy franchise?</p>
<p>Just watch Vin Diesel’s recent interviews</p>
<p>But that is the easy part. The real question is what is it about the actor that’s changing the way people see and think about movies, television, and film?</p>
<p>What’s most interesting are the answers to these five questions. It’s an often overlooked part of the overall process on the new Viacom-MTV documentary that airs on Sunday, Sept. 30. Vin Diesel’s answers will provide a window into the actor’s broader approach to work, and how his love for horror resonates as his character goes in unforeseen directions. Check out all five of Vin Diesel’s answers below the jump.</p>
<p>Why do you go and make movies after High School?</p>
<p>To make movies, on a daily basis, and to do it with family by the end. I majored in marketing in high school, and I met my wife in college. She was just as passionate about movies as I was. She saw the opportunity to make things happen, and became the kind of marketing person that I wanted to be, in her own way, in college. I graduated from college with an associate’s in cinema and graphic design. The rest is history.</p>
<p>What is it you make for family?</p>
<p>I make some things for the people who I don’t necessarily work with anymore. They just didn’t get it and it’s because there’s a lot of stuff going on right now that we’re not making any time, like me being able to do the movies I want to make. At the same time, I get a lot of satisfaction from working with people and seeing that happen. I’ve also done some short films. Who knows, maybe I’ll be even better at short films, like, even now, they’re kind of my first project. All I can do is concentrate on what I love.</p>
<p>Who do you respect as an actor?</p>
<p>I don’t really use that term. What people in Hollywood tend to say is how I was somebody with passion. Even when I was a fan, back then I was somebody with passion.</p>
