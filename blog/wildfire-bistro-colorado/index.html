<h1>Wildfire Bistro Colorado</h1>
<p>Named one of the top five restaurants in the nation by USA Today, Colorado’s newest and best dining establishment is one of the finest establishments in the world for modern French cuisine. It is a family-run restaurant that never goes out of business. I was here for 2 weeks and it is worth the time to go and take a look.</p>
<p>I had an amazing time tasting all of the great things there is to taste. The menu is changing most every day with great new items. I was all over their charcuterie board with a few of my favorite choices and got to peek behind the glass. It was a great dining experience filled with great food and the staff friendly. Definitely recommended. For dinner and drinks be sure to stick around a bit after you leave to taste everything they have to offer.</p>
<h2>About The Experience</h2>
<p>They have free unlimited parking. You get to the main lot, a covered patio, a large upstairs dining room where your food will be served, and free wireless internet access</p>
<p>
You can wander right into the dining room from the parking lot or take the nearby back alley staircase to reach it<br>
You can sit in the restaurant or go upstairs to get your dinner any where inside<br>
You are offered a drink station on each of the tables<br>
You never have to remove your shoes<br>
You can eat immediately when your table is ready<br>
It is very spacious, I was able to observe the people’s weight and the chefs attention to detail<br>
They have new options on many of the dinner plates<br>
The outdoor courtyard area has a large variety of different cuisines served<br>
The outdoor seating is nice because it allows you to sit outside when you like<br>
</p>
<p>As you can tell from the title, the entire menu is changing daily. For example, the amazing Red Tuna Burger, made from the tiny little piece of belly from a red tuna drum set, is changing weekly. They did not stop growing until they took it out of the case.</p>
<h2>The Breakfast &amp;amp; Dinner Menu</h2>
<p>Our Choice of Pastries and bread.</p>
<p>For French people, I like to get the cheese or puff pastry with coffee or tea. They have varieties of both as well as a dessert selection. There are six different varieties of coffee and a variety of teas. Their bread is available as is and an assortment of cheeses and fruits.</p>
