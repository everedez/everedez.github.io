Sometimes, being an artist is really bad. It&amp;#x27;s not hard for me to understand why this is because ever since the turn of the millennium, I have had a hard time getting my act together with the media outlets; artists, publishers, writers, record label people. It&amp;#x27;s a bit like a roller coaster ride. And I think, you know... everyone would like to feel like they have something, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t always bring in anything.">

<h1>Drop Dead Diva Rigged</h1>

<p>Sometimes, being an artist is really bad. It&amp;#x27;s not hard for me to understand why this is because ever since the turn of the millennium, I have had a hard time getting my act together with the media outlets; artists, publishers, writers, record label people. It&amp;#x27;s a bit like a roller coaster ride. And I think, you know... everyone would like to feel like they have something, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t always bring in anything. It&amp;#x27;s not like I wanted anything else, for example; I just wanted to be a writer. I wanted be a prolific writer. And, you know, I guess because I have always felt that, you know, everything I create is crap, a lot of what I create will never live up or even get paid up for what the public wants. No matter what. And so if I can just take this opportunity to express for you my frustration, you know I don&amp;#x27;t even like being asked this question, but I will say what I always say. That is, you see, the reason why I put myself out there to be an artist or a writer I am saying is because I&amp;#x27;m the type of person who likes to think that my art is better in some way. Because I&amp;#x27;m not a perfect person, I want to become more perfect. And also, I don&amp;#x27;t want to do anything that will make people feel like I will lose my livelihood. Because, you know, I&amp;#x27;ve done some things to be a writer who got out and the results were that people viewed me as irresponsible because my focus went only to being a writer and not really being an artist. And I don&amp;#x27;t like that, honestly. That may sound kind of ridiculous, but when I read things about my art from other people it seems like they&amp;#x27;re being selective. They are not being selective in the way that I want people to see my art. And I&amp;#x27;m not a real perfectionist, you know? I&amp;#x27;m not a perfectionist. (laughs) And I want my art to be beautiful and beautiful, beautiful art. Some of my art is beautiful and others is ugly. And maybe, maybe you need to take up that task and make your art better so it&amp;#x27;s appreciated by others, okay? And maybe you need to believe in yourself. And I just didn&amp;#x27;t do that.</p>
