<h1>Dr Oveta Fuller</h1>
<p>A group of researchers from the prestigious Harvard Medical School just uncovered the chemical mechanism behind what’s referred to as a rare and extremely dangerous drug. This miraculous drug is called Norbelline™ which is manufactured from the flowering tops of the tiny Veronica, a variety of carrot known as kachcha.</p>
<p>“Norbelline (Xanthotoxin) has been used for nearly two decades as a treatment for cancer and stroke.”</p>
<p>NORBELINE is an original formula designed to use a modified version of Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that acts as a redox regulator. It has been researched and developed by a team of the prestigious Harvard Medical School – an elite and renowned department in the world of medicine.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Norbelline has now been used in hundreds of countries, there have still been no clinical studies published on the drug. But in a recent online study published in Nature, a team of researchers from the prestigious Harvard Medical School just uncovered the chemical mechanism behind what’s referred to as a rare and extremely dangerous drug.</p>
<p>It was named “a new form of clinical drug therapy” – and all the trials of this life-changing new compound “have been positive”, says the research team led by ‘HMD’ Professor Krishna Narayana, Director, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Analytical Chemistry, Division of Experimental Therapeutics.</p>
<p>However, the scientists admit that the clinical trials that were conducted on Norbelline has the potential to have implications for those who will consume the drug.</p>
<p>“We are very worried about the implications for what happens if we decide to expose humans to all the aspects of the Norbelline. We do not envisage a scenario where patients will overdose on Norbelline,” Narayana explains.</p>
<p>One of the implications of this discovery is the possibility to bring Norbelline to the market. This drug, which is originally priced at over Rs 6 million per vial, has already entered the world of children and has been widely used as an infant formula.</p>
<p>The study was conducted at Stanford Research Institute in India. Some of the subjects of the study were given the Norbelline vial for about two days to observe the effect on their health systems.</p>
