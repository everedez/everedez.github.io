<p>
You and your friends can do cool stuff around the forest. The bear can make you get something for lunch.<br>

<h2>Scenarios:</h2>
<p>Bear A – You and your friend head over to North Pole for a visit to Scrooge. You’ve been staying there for a long time.</p>
<p>You and your friends find a cave in the woods.</p>
<p>She and Scrooge try to take the girl home. Bear is a bit of a coward so he tries to take her somewhere with least resistance.</p>
<p>Beam doesn’t know how to exit the cave, so Scrooge takes him back to the forest. There is a puma.</p>
<p>Everyone runs after the puma. The puma leaves.</p>
<p>You and your friends meet up. At the end of the day, if the bear doesn’t eat another of your friends, you have to split it with him. The bear leaves just as the sun went down while his friends are getting close to the end of the day.</p>
<p>A bear and several humans are very interested in the body of a man whom they meet while scavenging for food. The man is one of you. The bear decides to make another snack for himself.</p>
<p>Scene changes. The puma turns up in the woods again.</p>
<p>If the bear ate the next victim, the bear would get hungry and would attack the next person. The bear decides it will wait to eat another person, so he will get the puma. This might get interesting. Scrooge arrives and wants the bear to give her something to eat. As Scrooge talks to the bear, the bear shoves Scrooge to the ground, so Scrooge gives the bear his pistol and his knife to protect herself.</p>
<p>The bear would rather stay close to the puma than try to get away.</p>
<p>Scene changes. The second victim is not as surprised by the bear as he is to the bear. The second victim tries to cross the path of the bear. The bear gets him then runs away. The second person comes and pleads with the puma.</p>
<p>Boulder doesn’t see how to exit the cave either.</p>
