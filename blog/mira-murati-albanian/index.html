<h1>Mira Murati Albanian</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>She was born in Agrokaski, Kutaisi, Kutahya Province to Mavievlci Muradzovic Murad, a community leader, and his wife Mihosi Dandori, a member of the prominent Albanian-Slovenian family of the Antalian branch of the Muradzovic family. She was raised in the Antalian family of the Muradzovics, but had attended and completed the prestigious grammar school in Lhuhl in northern Albania.</p>
<p>Being a staunch defender of Albanian culture and heritage, Muradzovic worked on a creative project to promote it and he is considered a hero of the region and of the West Albanian community, and a true proponent of Albanian-Slovenian culture. The project was run by one of his family members, Mihosi Dandori Dermoklisq, and focused on rebuilding the beauty of the valley region to revitalize the quality of life and stimulate economic development within it.</p>
<p>Mihovi works for Kosovo ASSh, and was appointed as a director of the regional entity set up to recover the majority of territories under the “Murs” flag, which the Kosovo Albanian youth movement groups initially tried to do. However, this move backfired on the Albanian side. He worked on a project at the district of Shkodra for Kosovo with Albanian partners to clean up the city ruins, offering a prize of 100,000 liras for the best renovation project that could be completed within 10 years.</p>
<p>His ideas came from work that he himself did, and he saw how nature can return to nature after centuries of emptiness and depletion. Muradzovic himself was intrigued and was inspired by the project, and so saw the opportunity to create his own urban renewal design, paving the way for various other projects of his work.</p>
<p>Miti never missed a chance to engage in projects, which has given him an idea on how to organize projects and creative energy to his work and people, while also encouraging mutual trust and understanding between his group and various organizations that want to do good work.</p>
