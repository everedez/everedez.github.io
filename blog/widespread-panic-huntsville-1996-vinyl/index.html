<h1>Widespread Panic Huntsville 1996 Vinyl</h1>
<p>I knew this would happen, this is what I predicted for one of my original picks. I wanted to include something so I could get the blood boiling and create a truly interesting event. These are quite rare, with less than twenty copies being found on eBay.</p>
<p>This is how I left it up there in hopes that someone would be listening (and laughing to themselves) to &amp;quot;Hail the Conquer.&amp;quot; Anyone have any questions? Feel free to ask or leave for I have no further questions.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who listened.</p>
<p>Some of you may remember that I did a DJ mix &amp;quot;3 Days of Sin&amp;quot; and now I am doing a remix of &amp;quot;Hail The Conquer.&amp;quot; So far, this particular record has been found for:</p>
<p>
3 eBay results, but no info on price or information as to if it ever sold.<br>
You can tell that someone found the record...<br>

<p>So I was just talking with a fan (via my FB page) and he was telling me that someone would be buying it from him because it was going on 6&amp;quot; at the time, and then all of a sudden on May 9, the record was 10.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;What is this?&amp;quot; My roommate was saying it was starting to get attention, he couldn&amp;#x27;t believe it.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;What is this?&amp;quot; When I found out it was going to happen I went about revising all of my list except this one.</p>
<p>So anyways I keep checking it for any sign of possible confusion, no info on price, no sales thread, only a D.J.&amp;#x27;s station once and he put it on the air, and people just kind of heard it and that&amp;#x27;s all I&amp;#x27;m hearing anymore.</p>
