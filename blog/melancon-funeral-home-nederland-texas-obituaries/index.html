<h1>Melancon Funeral Home Nederland Texas Obituaries</h1>
<h3>Funeral Info</h3>
<h3>Melancon Funeral Home, Inc.</h3>
<p>The entire Melancon family, without any exception, served their memories honorably. Even one of our staff members, Bob, when he was terminated from service at the funeral home, in memory of our beloved brother Wilfred Melancon, continued to honor us until our last breath. We could not ask for a better bunch of mourners.</p>
<p>The Funeral Home has done a superb job in making our site a very special place. It is obvious to us that the staff, personnel, and all others have taken the time to go over everything that was involved. The items that are displayed in our office are an effort in maintaining our family history and raising our profile for future reference. For those of you who enjoy doing that, you can help by clicking on any of the items that you see on our home page, click here. The time that the staff members of Melancon have spent researching the facts and memorializing our wonderful brother Wilfred Melancon are the best that anybody could ask of them.</p>
<p>If you would like us to help your group, we would be happy to do so. Please consider meeting us at our site and having a look around. There are many memories that are yours to enjoy. We will be glad to share them with you.</p>
<p>
Our heartfelt condolences to the entire Melancon family.<br>

</p>
<p>A highly successful Funeral Home owner located on the outskirts of Fort Worth in the city&amp;#x27;s Oak Cliff area. The new Melancon funeral home was built in 1986 and is known for excellence in design and maintenance, making them one of the state&amp;#x27;s top family-run funeral homes.</p>
<p>A former family-run mortuary was once located on the west side of Fort Worth. Today, the heart of the current Melancon family can be found, with all of your other great memories being gathered together in one location.</p>
