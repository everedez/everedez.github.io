<h1>Damascus A Ruinous Heap</h1>
<p>It’s not my fault that the UN once described Ukraine as a “permanent crisis.”</p>
<p>It is of course important to respect the sovereignty of other countries, so it’s not my goal to incite the Russian bear to rampage through the streets. However, when U.S. officials are so desperate to see another Ukrainian country take the lead in a new war that Ukraine has little hope of winning, it’s quite understandable why they would lobby the UN for more help in Ukraine. And the result would be a state or people occupying the ruins of Kiev’s former capital, being forced to pay for it by the billions.</p>
<p>The resulting chaos would guarantee that other countries would become afraid of Russia, making it impossible for Moscow’s “normals” to survive for long and bringing the whole world to its knees.</p>
<p>You may be wondering if you actually live in Warsaw, or any other western state. Well, we don’t have a green “hatband” with a red “necktie” in our embassy building, so not to worry.</p>
<p>Russia was not the first to win the post-Ukrainian chaos lottery. In fact, it might even be the second! One could still argue that after the Russians’ World War II era of “manifest destiny,” Russia has no moral reason for occupying the very land that it grew up and built. But considering the Soviet Union used to be a superpower, the country’s first wartime effort to take territory from another country would be quite understandable and justified. And there’s no telling how many other countries did such things, starting with WWII.</p>
<p>It is, however, true that the Ukrainian crisis has naturally reached a new level in the eyes of the international community. Thus, with the new “stability” measures Russia implemented recently, the new ceasefire has been accepted as a major accomplishment. One also wonders how much more people in other countries are willing to sacrifice to preserve stability in their own countries’ borders. Thus, the Russian bear made news because it has now taken over a city in the Gagarin region. The city is under Russian occupation, and the animals have eaten, driven out, and murdered several thousand people.</p>
