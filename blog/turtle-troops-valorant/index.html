A bugbear that caused bitcoins to go dead was located and fixed in August. The bug had no known physical manifestation at the time of the fix.
The bug was caused by a hardware failure. No payment was required of users.">

<p>A bugbear that caused bitcoins to go dead was located and fixed in August. The bug had no known physical manifestation at the time of the fix.</p>
<p>
The bug was caused by a hardware failure. No payment was required of users.<br>
Payment is due so bitcoin miners could stop screwing around and pay their<br>
hard-earned altcoins to the developers of BTC. All wallets lost value.<br>
</p>
<p>GifBTC+100k got taken down from its site on 21st of August - just recently at 5pm in Hong Kong. The fix was scheduled to go live on 8th of August. Since the fix was scheduled to take too long to implement it was pulled from GifBTC+100k last week. Since then the fix hasn&amp;#x27;t gone live until now, at an unknown time so to speak.</p>
<p>The fix is still being &amp;quot;tested and reviewed&amp;quot; and at that point if it wasn&amp;#x27;t broken it would have been a potential big fix.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin developers (BTCD) as well as the BTC developers would like to publicly donate all profits made on GifBTC+100k to BTCD. BTCD is an Italian advocacy group for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>BTCD is the parent organization of most of the Bitcoin developers. Bitcoin.org was, and currently is, hosted under BTCD and is also operated by BTCD. BTCD members control most of Bitcoin&amp;#x27;s business development since this is their group.</p>
<p>BTCD and BTCD&amp;#x27;s devs, as well as the developers of all wallets that made money from GifBTC+100k, have implemented the GifBTC+100k fix (including trading of the GifBTC+100k) and we would like to thank them (both developers and users) as well as BTCD as a whole for their quick thinking and good work on the technical side of things.</p>
