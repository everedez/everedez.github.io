<h1>St Jude Knitting Challenge 2023</h1>
<p>Oz’s 25th anniversary was well-taken and he’s gone from strength to strength. Ozzy’s was a lifetime. Hopefully this will be an exciting 25 for us all.</p>
<p>The challenge from The Beatles. (Crown City 2013)(Image by www.siegeldrainage.com)</p>
<p>Last night at 8 PM London time (or 6pm this morning), for The Beatles 5-3-2012 the iconic J. Yngwie And G. Jones defeated the (Brontë)s, The Sex Pistols and The Who all in one night out on London’s busiest station, Olympic.</p>
<p>One of our previous hosts – an Oxford graduate – is now back with his new blog, taking a stab at cracking the popular Beatle magazine story – whether it was the recent gig in Ealing, for example, or what was first turned into a 7″ single by John Lennon in 1965 which managed to somehow escape the traditional Beatle press.</p>
<p>For the task at hand in Knitting It 2012, we’ll have to follow one of our members, Sophie, onto the Sunday Times and look at the 1960 Beatles’ record, The Beatles Play Something True As They Wanna Be The Modern Ones LP which oughta go perfectly with the design of the challenge. Her photo is here, to be exact.</p>

<h2>Last Night: 1. Beatles 5-3-2012, 4pm to 7pm, Olympic</h2>
<p>Muzak: Steve Farrant, who owns the radio station in the Olympic Village, is to play a 60s pop/rock vibe which mixes in John as their lead singer, with Paul’s song ‘Always, Always’ and George’s ‘I Want To Hold Your Hand’.</p>
<p>The deadline for entry in all categories is midnight. And we need entrants between 19 December 2011 and 14 January 2012. To hear our entries, feel free to get in touch by our commenting system below.</p>
<p>The last UK knitting convention (albeit in a tiny uniset format) was in Newcastle back in 2015.</p>
