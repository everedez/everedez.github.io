<h1>Lorex Verification Code</h1>
<h3>Lorex Verify</h3>
<p>The Lorex-Verify Project is dedicated to the verification of lorex wallets to eliminate the occurrence of the following problems:</p>
<p>Double Address – The user creates an address for a hidden account, which has two addres, for example:</p>
<p>– One address is for an address of their “friends” which can be spent or forgotten.</p>
<p>– Another address is used when paying for a vendor fee from a hidden account.</p>
<p>The “friend” account belongs to a fictitious or unauthorized person, for example:</p>
<p>– A “friend” with two accounts, with the addresses 1 and 2. This will cause double addresses, especially in the case of a situation when someone borrows or sells their “friend’s” account and hides it to generate funds. The client will be using address 0 for their “friend” account, even if it’s a real account.</p>
<p>In some case:</p>
<p>The user or an employee shows a “friend” account, which belongs to an illegal organization and never accepted the payments. Therefore, the “friend” account contains two address, one of which belongs to the legal organization, the other to the illegal organization.</p>
<p>These problems can be addressed by the use of a random or a seed address.</p>
<p>Existing implementations of the Lorex code have serious flaws, often leaving vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the proposed solution consists of a pair of modules:</p>
<p>
Lorex Module : Core functions specific to each wallet and the main<br>
function for the wallet as a whole, this module will be used to check a specific<br>
functionality of our wallets, such as the usage of a specified memory pool or<br>
the input generation of coins.<br>
The LMWG Module : Module for reading and writing to the library<br>
structure (Lorex wallet)<br>
Lorex Verification Code<br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the configuration are structured to have two modules that interact with the wallet (module for each wallet module: core, and</p>
<p>module for the whole wallet: LMWG). This structure makes it easy to compare these modules because all the functions are organized in one code structure, a set</p>
<p>of functions stored in memory.</p>
