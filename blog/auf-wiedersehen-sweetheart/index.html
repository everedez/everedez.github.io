<h1>Auf Wiedersehen Sweetheart</h1>
<p>She’s had a tough start to her music career, particularly after signing with Shins in 2009. Since she first played the song “Love U Right,” her work only grew-in. Prior to leaving Shins in 2018, she released “Light,” (2014’s “Crazy with You”), and in collaboration with Grimes which Shins/Releasing Label Spine recently licensed for distribution “Love U Right” (as “Fall Out Boy”) landed on Billboard’s Adult Alternative Songs airplay chart.</p>
<p>Grimes will continue performing and recording with the Shins Band, but remains in the limelight on Sweetheart as her own band name.</p>
<p>Sweetheart may be a tough act for artists to duplicate, but they do need a little help. To facilitate such a feat, we asked her musicians to reach out to her, assist with arrangements, and create some exciting music as we approach a year of Sweetheart and Sweetheart’s Sweetheart Month. Take a listen to our exclusive sampling of the fine sweet-girl.</p>
<h2>“Sweetheart” Lyrics</h2>
<h3>Crowd Favorite Most Requested Song</h3>
<p>Of all our best Sweetheart moments, “Sweetheart” was the most requested song of them all, with a full minute worth of people singing and dancing. We also tried something new for the video: a shout-out to Sweetheart herself, as she works to overcome the fear of childhood that rears up when she ventures too far from her base.</p>
