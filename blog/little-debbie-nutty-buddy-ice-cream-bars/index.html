<h1>Little Debbie Nutty Buddy Ice Cream Bars</h1>
<p>Get them at your favorite ice cream shop. They should be easy to eat in the morning. Once you are used to them you won’t even think of biting into them.</p>
<p>Buy some paper towels and freeze it in a single serving bag (three serves) because when you defrost them, they are sooo gooey soft you won’t even think to refrigerate it again.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I love chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I could sleep anywhere in the house, almost. I love when my children make time for me!</p>
<p>I love getting to know my sister, who is not my parents but we still have wonderful times together. I love reading, organizing crafts, dancing and just spending the time!</p>
<p>I love tea. If something comes in my tea I take a sip and am done. I love, love, love tea!</p>
<p>I love meeting people who make time for you when the feeling of not being appreciated goes away… and I love it when they tell me their favorite memory. I feel a weirdness inside. Have a great day!!</p>
<p>Why? Because I feel like our culture has forgotten about us. There are so many of us that it’s hard for us to connect with one another.</p>
<h2>Get The Timed Recipe To Prepare</h2>
<p>Begin with:</p>
<p>Preparation time: 15 minutes</p>
<p>In a small pot, melt the butter with the cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg and sugar. Sauté on very low heat for about 5 minutes until they thicken. Stir and continue to cook with low heat stirring frequently if you’re not careful! Pour into a bowl and stir and constantly, stir to ensure all the ingredients are incorporated.</p>
<p>Melt the brown sugar in the microwave with a pinch of kosher salt, for about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>While the sugar is melting, begin mixing everything that has been made into the ice cream as soon as the sugar has melted (see above) with a spoon.</p>
<p>Add the cereal, green powder, chocolate chips, bourbon and vanilla chunks.</p>
<p>Pour the ice cream mixture into the bowl with the butter mixture and stir until combined. Let chill in the freezer a few hours or overnight.</p>
