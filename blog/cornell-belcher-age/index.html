<h1>Cornell Belcher Age</h1>
<p>Deactivated the College after 3 years of no major progress for hundreds of students. His office was ordered to allow no new members of New Cornell A+. The College was forced to leave in early &amp;#x27;99 and no president for years. Left over teachers left to teach in the Cathedral schools. All the classrooms were dismantled after the fall of 1999.</p>
<p>Deactivated all the labs and had them all packed up as &amp;quot;historic and historical buildings&amp;quot;.</p>
<p>Deactivated the financial aid offices and moved all student&amp;#x27;s applications and state awards from other buildings to his own. That enabled him to give $10 mill to teachers without any review, oversight, or coordination.</p>
<p>Deactivated or black listed faculty for gross incompetence, absence or neglect in the matter of supporting students.</p>
<p>Confirmed no past or present teachers who were to be fired, resigned, reprimanded or banned from holding an office.</p>
<p>Contested past and present teachers who were to be passed over or banned for gross incompetence or the dismissal of many.</p>
<p>When he was confirmed he then informed all faculty and staff there were 2 classes where people were denied tenure.</p>
<p>Those two classes were the History department and the Social welfare studies department. One such teacher who was denied tenure was chosen by the hiring committee to teach the new social studies classes. He was forced to teach half the class in the upper and upper middle schools to get enough material in for the History classes to justify the position. His class was randomly assigned, and then had to train the teachers to incorporate that person&amp;#x27;s bias into the classroom. After he left the College, or was black listed by his office, he was demoted to a lesser position in his class. At that time there had been a decision made by the Hall of Fame Committee that was intended for the faculty as a whole, not just him. One of the other teachers he was blacklisted for was forced to attend a meeting for only the reason that he was a History teacher and was not available to teach it since he had a religious exception from the law. ( See also Religious exceptions from law ) He was finally required to teach this class instead.</p>
<p>He established a pseudo-university that claims to be a college, but that was shut down in early September, 1999. That school name was Deactivated College, which had been in existence as a virtual state university for the campus.</p>
