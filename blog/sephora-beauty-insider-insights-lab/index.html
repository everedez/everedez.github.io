<p>Kopitiam School, a School of Pharmacy alumni association, posted on its official blog:</p>
<p>“Today, I am delighted to announce that after repeated planning and a lot of R&amp;amp;D work, we have launched on Wednesday, the first Kopitiam School. This is truly a very exciting opportunity for us and also for some of our alumni who happen to be in this city. We have carefully selected an area in Mumbai in which to start our education, one that can bring about employment, and which fits in both the very competitive nature of a much sought-after job and the beauty industry. On 1st June, we have commenced our study from 200 persons, consisting predominantly of our alumni from Class 7, who have never made their way to India.”</p>
<p>The Kopitiam School of Pharmacy School offers post-graduate training for aspirants seeking employment in the beauty industry. The School also looks to strengthen the brand of the pharmacy. To date, over 2,000 students in the final year have completed Post Graduate Degrees in the fields of Nursing and Social Work.</p>
<p>Corporate students in Mumbai will attend four post-graduate cycles, three at Kopitiam School, which last three years, and one at their campus of origin at Kumarakom, in New Delhi. Kumarakom is the corporate campus of Kotwal, a global outsourcing company which provides administrative and HR services to more than 100,000 businesses around the world.</p>
