<h3>LATEST NEWS ON HUSBAND &amp;amp; WIFE STORIES FROM AUSTRALIA</h3>
<p>The Australian Sex Party, one of the 12 founding members, has openly declared they want to abolish parental roles in a new newspaper they have just launched under the title of Parenting Australia. The Australian Sex Party stands for:</p>
<p>“The responsibilities of parents should now be recognised, including that they should not interfere with teenagers’ lives, their schedules, and that they should manage the schools and class schedules for their children’s education as best they can.”</p>
<p>The Australian Sex Party’s website says: “The Australian Sex Party is a non-political, non-sociopathic humanist movement that proposes a non-staunch defence of parental rights and the protection of children against the “alienating effects of the adult male role” within their families…” The proposed changes would be not the end of parental involvement, nor are they an end to parental roles being recognised; rather, they are merely the start of the reclassification of family roles and an inquiry of family attitudes and behaviours toward teenage girls.”</p>
<p>But The Sex Party failed to detail any of their plans for parental involvement. As John Key says in the announcement: “We don’t think we should be a part of it.” So I will have to do something about it.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing I say will change the views of the parents who hold those views but I will not dwell on those opinions if I don’t have to. I hope many of the parents may be more concerned with the idea of parental involvement being given a better definition.</p>
<p>What we should ask about are the aims of this publication. What does it hope to achieve and what can it accomplish?</p>
<p>As my children are growing up today, I often wonder about parental involvement. A significant factor in this is the age that children are spending a lot of time with. During my student years they were not attending many family or community events and it was usually to be found on a Sunday morning. My 12-year-old, being a typical, “mature” teenager, does not have many school activities.</p>
