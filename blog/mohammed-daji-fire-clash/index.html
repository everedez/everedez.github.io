<h1>Mohammed Daji Fire Clash</h1>
<p>Ramblings by Ayaan Hirsi Ali: &amp;quot;Arrested at the International Center with 29 of her supporters was the irrefutable evidence of the fallacious left-wing plot to destabilize her life and gain absolute control over Somalia. Arrested for supporting the opposition coalition that holds all power in Somalia, who also expelled all the opposition leaders and appointed their friends and associates because they oppose the current government and seek anarchy in Somalia.</p>
<p>Somalia is ruled by a totalitarian Government, not the ‘democracy&amp;#x27; that are so clamoring for in these time. The violent coup is the proof of their tyrannical behavior, and the reasons they need support.</p>
<p>Without the support, al Shabaab in Somalia will even come out of their cells and show that is a true democracy and that it is not them that will end up with power here. But who will hold all power in Somalia, all authority in Somalia and that will mean the disappearance and domination by the “Beltuva”, including by those who demand that their blood be spilled.</p>
<p>
The &amp;#x27;Somali Revolution&amp;#x27; is about to come, and this time it will come with violence, not peace!&amp;quot;<br>

Dear Brother Mohamed,<br>
</p>
<p>For years now, your Sunday quote has not changed much. I feel that it’s really been the same a year ago, a year and a half ago, a year and a half earlier.</p>
<p>As for the news what happened last Saturday, let it suffice to tell you what happened during last Saturday.</p>
<p>Somalia has been stuck without an intelligent government for some time, or for quite some time. The only party who has stood for the nation’s future is Somalia-based Islamic Movement for Federalism (MMIF). This party is known as Islamic Courts and Tribunals (ICT). If you did not understand, I will explain to you simply.</p>
<p>A series of decisions have led to this situation. Firstly, all political parties have formed the Islamic Courts and Tribunals Council (ICT) and a government that was formed mostly to hold religious courts. What that means is that each religious court has its own government.</p>
