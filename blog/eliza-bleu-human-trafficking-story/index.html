<h1>Eliza Bleu Human Trafficking Story</h1>
<h3>(Read More: People Who Listen: “Life With EZH4”)</h3>
<p>It started as a routine visit to a doctor to obtain a prescription for a medication, only to discover one day that he couldn’t find it, and had been stealing the medication from his store. Now, some three years later, we’re visiting a doctor, and we’re discovering it wasn’t such a routine visit.</p>
<p>“I used your healthcare system. I stole your drugs.”</p>
<p>It was a nurse who told us.</p>
<p>“It’s happened again. We just did a survey. One in three of us now uses your system in the first hour of our doctor visit.”</p>
<p>An escort and student midwife named Elizabeth explained how different it is for less-educated people – we’re seeing more elderly people on their own – to receive their child development education.</p>
<p>There are other examples.</p>
<p>But that story is perhaps the most important in terms of how the world can be a better place. It’s a story from a woman who doesn’t have a powerful individual in her life – I refer to her as Elizabeth, because she clearly doesn’t trust her intuition and her guidance – but she has children she would love to be the mother of. That’s the other part of her story.</p>
<p>
The story comes from a population she recognises as the Amish, who don’t have any male lineage members.<br>
But of course, there is one man in her life: her husband, Caleb.<br>
She struggles with whether they will keep going, which brings us to the story of Amanda.<br>
The story comes from a population she recognises as the Amish, who don’t have any male lineage members.<br>
</p>
<p>Her husband, Caleb, is a man of the Book of Mormon, and their life has not been easy. He has made some bad decisions in his past, he’s had some difficult growing up within the faith, and has made a lot of great sacrifices for her, most notably the loss of their youngest child.</p>
