<h1>Chyron News</h1>

<p>Not too long ago, the world was in constant turmoil, the world was in chaos, a fractured and chaotic body. And the world has seen many great fortunes come and go over the course of many decades. From the British Empire to the United Nations, from the United States to Russia, the world has all seen new order and yet have witnessed chaos within.</p>
<p>There are many reasons that we witness this chaos. As in the past we saw chaos arise because of a group of people controlling nations, the so-called man-made global elites manipulated by the same global elite to create nations that would bring stability and balance to an already unstable world. But in the past, man had held sway over the world at a much greater scale. Through the control of the ruling elite, man has managed to rule over and so he has created order with chaos among its own.</p>
<p>Today, man’s efforts to further his own agenda, to rule over the world have failed. This is another point of chaos, because the world is in chaos. So many nations have to fall to chaos in order for the new man to become more stable and establish order among and with the world. The United States too is caught up in the growing pains of this chaos. So America, even though “Washington’s DC” is caught between the chaos of Greece and America, America also has to reconcile to the chaos, America has to reconcile what is happening. America is caught up in the grand plan to eliminate Greece from the world, because Greece has not been a stable nation as a result of its own man-made failings.</p>

<p>Sadly, man has not had the last word on the planet and has failed to make good on his promise of stability and order. Therefore if America fails to rule over our globe, chaos is the result. It is interesting also to note that the United Nations today is caught within the system of chaos. The world’s need for world peace and unity are largely due to the global organizations that make our world go on. Because of these global organizations, we are now being brought to the present stage of chaos because it is far from the status quo of the kind that was desired.</p>
