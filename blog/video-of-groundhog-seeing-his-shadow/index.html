<h1>Video Of Groundhog Seeing His Shadow</h1>
<p>“Where are my children,” Mary repeated her harsh tone. Her new daughter was not about to say “I told you so.”</p>
<p>The two siblings had come from a long line of teachers — six generations — and their parents were former rock-ribbed judges. For the last fifteen years, the youngest and most difficult of the family jobs had been helping the eldest settle into her marriage, raising two grown children, and managing the family farm. As Mary had carried out her duties with a dedication and a passion that was both fierce and satisfying, she and her husband were beloved in the town of Uxbridge in the province of Ontario. What they did was not easy work, and they were not popular. By the time the youngest son was seven, the family had experienced a rough time in the two years since the death of their grandfather. The brothers had finally let go of their mother’s handmaiden, who was about to start an eight-year apprenticeship and was one of the two smallest workers in the family. They were not the most dependable workers, and they had picked up scrapes along their way. But many town folk were impressed by the “new Mary”: she had a career of her own and managed a house in a neat little Victorian house close to the church. People liked Mary for her peace, her talent, and her reliability. The youngest boy, who had been brought up by a tutor, shared Mary’s small inheritance and allowed her to live in her family’s house. They were good kids who even liked to feed their dad when he got that way.</p>
<p>But after only a few years, Mary’s worst enemy, the dour widower who had already gone to the police more than twice, and who was accused of threatening the family in his divorce proceedings, got hold of the family farm and took them out of their hands. After that bad experience, Mary had begun to think of her own children as the “good kids.” She did not believe that the family would have to struggle so hard in order to feed themselves. The youngest of the children was already a teenager by this time, and her husband was away doing long days at war. The family was barely surviving, even with the help of the two sisters, both of whom were “good girls.</p>
