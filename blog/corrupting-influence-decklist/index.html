<h1>Corrupting Influence Decklist</h1>
<p>At the top-end of the article I will just attempt to name some of the decks that I find to be very good and easy to play and maybe will help you develop your own style which plays a 3-in-a-row game.</p>
<p>There are some cards in this deck that you don’t use and some of them need to be part of your overall idea of a deck. This list is mostly about the decks that are core and the decks that can be in a “2 in a row” style of playing but there are other areas that also need to be looked at.</p>
<p>I run 3 in a row when I play my games sometimes just because of how competitive they are, and to be honest I don’t really care how competitive they are since I am just happy playing them. Here’s a list of 3 in a row which I will be running throughout this review:</p>
<h2>1. Miracles</h2>
<p>I think Miracles is a very consistent and very solid deck, but let’s face it: playing it is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>The big problem with Miracles is their loss of the game plan. In both the Tumble and Tumble 2 Era seasons, it was one of the only ways to win a game. In Tumble 2 Era players beat you to 5 by controlling their board state.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair there was one season where the guys don’t win enough games to make up for this and we had Miracles falling apart in places. Players could lose the game because they would stall for nothing while playing a control deck. This usually led to you losing the game when you were ahead and you wouldn’t lose the game and you lost out.</p>
<p>This is a problem no matter how well you play it, when your deck is as in-sync with the game plan as the Game Play Mechanic of Miracles.</p>
<p>Overall the Gameplay Mechanic ofMiracles does work pretty well and it’s clearly more-in-sync than the more focused decks. There are some changes that need to be made and that is what this list tries to sort out.</p>
<p>This list is very big on removal power in the sideboard itself, but you still have a lot of options to try and play around it.</p>
