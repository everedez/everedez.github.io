<p>Advanced Technology Group is the online ticketing event organizers. These services were founded to put a ticketing industry on the Internet. We provide a completely web based security and payment system and are ready to deploy solutions to help you with your ticketing needs.</p>
<p>The most basic security of the ticketing industry is a box containing your paid for tickets. This is called a &amp;quot;ticket warehouse or box&amp;quot;. Depending on the security of the warehouse it is either private or public. This box is placed in a secure environment called a venue or club. The purpose of the event is to guarantee that you have your tickets for sale before you enter a space where someone else is doing the selling. There are three ways to enter and buy a ticket online:</p>
<p>1. Use the box and use the box to purchase your tickets through Advanced Technology Group.<br>
2. Order your tickets from Advanced Technology Group.<br>
3. You can print your ticket from your cell phone or computer.<br>
</p>
<p>The box is securely sealed and there is a lock with a security code you can enter to see your tickets. You will then have two ways to purchase your tickets.</p>
<p>- Order online or call and order. If you need new tickets you can order them in advance or when you arrive at the venue where you will have your tickets. You will be asked for a special code to unlock your box or purchase your tickets.</p>
<p>- If you are in a designated box your box has to be unlocked by entering the box code that is printed on your ticket. Once the box is unlocked your ticket will be mailed to you. If you need tickets again you can order them on the website. Your box code will be entered in a special phone order form and your tickets will be shipped to you.</p>
