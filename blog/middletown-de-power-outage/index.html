Over the past few days the FCC has received a number of complaints about the Middletown de-poweroutage, and in response to these concerns I am sending this FCC summary about the event:
On December 30th at 8 PM, the commission received a telecommunications request for the construction of the Middletown Expressway. The request stated that the next milepost would place powerlines within two and a half miles of the requested location, then from there the powerlines would be hidden and shut down the entire length of the de-poweroutage.">

<h1>Middletown De Power Outage</h1>
<p>FCC&amp;#x27;s Middletown De Power Outage Posted by Shigeru Kondo</p>
<p>Over the past few days the FCC has received a number of complaints about the Middletown de-poweroutage, and in response to these concerns I am sending this FCC summary about the event:</p>
<p>On December 30th at 8 PM, the commission received a telecommunications request for the construction of the Middletown Expressway. The request stated that the next milepost would place powerlines within two and a half miles of the requested location, then from there the powerlines would be hidden and shut down the entire length of the de-poweroutage. The request stated that the location selected was “an underground cable that is located east to west on County Road 1241.” The request indicated that “alternate routes for construction of the de-poweroutage will be available from eastern Michigan to western Ohio through the towns of Eaton and Bronson.”</p>
<p>The Middletown Project has denied the request for the construction of the Middletown Expressway and stated that alternate routes will be created to avoid the powerlines in question.</p>

<p>OK….this may sound a bit awkward so here’s a brief recap:</p>
<p>Back for only about ten years with the Middletown De-Power Outage of 2005, due to the Middletown, MSM project, there was a series of tests in the field that showed that underground power lines were being used to shut-down a 5 MIEGRAD, two lane, 30 MPH, intersection that was being built.</p>
<p>After the fact, the FCC acknowledged that they were keeping the powerlines open for safety reasons, but they stated that they were denying permission for the entire de-poweroutage.</p>
<p>Now in the wake of the outage, the FCC is trying to create as much confusion as possible in order to gain more public support for their FON/SPF actions!</p>
