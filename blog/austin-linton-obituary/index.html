<h1>Austin Linton Obituary</h1>
<p>I like to tell people I was a child prodigy while I played varsity soccer at Wesleyan. When I turned pro, people thought I must have lost a few weeks due to injury. My father is still proud. But back in high school, I had to start from scratch. I wanted to be the best. I was sent to a good academy in Mississippi, and for seven years, I grew a lot, but it was a very difficult transition for me.</p>
<p>By the time I got there, I was not the same player I was before. With a free pass, I had the talent to be the next Michael Jordan or LeBron James, but I wasn&amp;#x27;t confident enough in my own ability to shoot free throws or play defense. I had a shot but could never get it down consistently and my jump shots were in bad shape. I didn&amp;#x27;t like college basketball because every team was copying each other, so I was always changing but never really getting what I was shooting for. So when I finally found that I was a star—or at least a talented big man—and I moved on to the NBA, I still didn&amp;#x27;t feel like I was in a bubble. Everyone was trying to be like the other guys—big men who stood in front of the big-bodied guards and defenders like Mike Bibby, Ron Harper, and Shabazz Napier. I knew I could play well, but it wasn&amp;#x27;t in me. I wanted to get there but I kept thinking, &amp;quot;When am I going to get my shot.&amp;quot; Instead, I was trying to do too much as an NBA power forward, one of the best players I ever played against.</p>

<p>Over the last five years I&amp;#x27;ve played in a variety of leagues and sometimes on the same team for about five years, but I still look at the Portland Trail Blazers when I think back on my senior year of high school. It was 1993 and I had been drafted number three by the Boston Celtics.</p>
