<h1>The Rains Have Ceased Ffxiv</h1>
<p>“The Rains Have Ceased” – is every intro to Ffxiv a cut down version of our current end-of-year activity? We’ve done the unthinkable and we’ll be doing the unthinkable again, by releasing the last chapters of The Rains Have Ceased on the very same day as we kick off 2020 with our first full fan-funded FFXIV Mid. This is only the last in a collection of five parts. I look forward to your constructive feedback on the future of FFXIV – especially this one.</p>
<p>The way you enjoy that stuff:</p>
<p>
Art is always the key.<br>
Is it true that when you do a story without them, they never change it?<br>
Is that true of endings?<br>
Can there really be a “the end of any given scenario” (any map) without the actual end of that scenario?<br>
Why is the FFXIV update 2018 so sudden…<br>
</p>
<p>As promised before, here they are. Full-length versions of their posts and its further adventures. They’re more, dare I say, an anthology, with the story of Rains over again and the finale of the previous chapters in the same order as well. This also means that you’ll be able to re-read these chapters every year, as opposed to single posts, which does not feel like a change in approach. We really appreciate you continuing as Raining Light’s community of readers over time, and we would welcome you into our small community of fans into FFXIV. It’s a lot of fun and it’ll change the world. We hope that you make that change in the meantime, but please get to know us again here as FFXIV and our community would be so much easier and more complete if you did so. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>The ending of this year’s FFXIV Community has, therefore, followed that of the preceding year. That is to say it was not as successful as was hoped or planned in any way. We feel that our conclusion on the end of the previous five chapters is not something we can make an album of in the same day.</p>
