<h1>Gloomy Bear X Corpse</h1>
<p>THE ORIGINAL WORK (That is, the one that is on my body.)</p>
<p>Hey, anybody know a Cursor Game to do this in? Something where you would know the next step up from the traditional moving game? Like, an AI friendly cgame, or a game where you are rewarded for completing a puzzle on your own, or something like that. A step-up from the way it&amp;#x27;s played in the first Fallout games I&amp;#x27;ve played, there needs to be ways to do that kind of game. And since I&amp;#x27;m trying to be a regular here, I&amp;#x27;ve got to be the one to step in and check this out, because I could really use the help out there on a quality new cgame:) Anyway, thanks. Really, really, really, good job.</p>
<p>Please Note: I&amp;#x27;m not saying that this is a shoddy cgame, there are some really cool aspects that could come from this, and I have not confirmed the accuracy of this, nor put any level in anyway to create the illusion that I am saying this is a shoddy cgame. I&amp;#x27;m saying that these are not done a natural cgame, and could use a change in philosophy for them - although I am still open for suggestions and if you find it to be lacking, I would truly appreciate it if you could drop a comment here on the forums and I would definitely appreciate it if you kindly could drop a comment here on the forums as well. Thanks also to whoever took the time to make this. Thanks again. Hopefully I can hold on to this and not piss it all away before all the negative community feedback runs dry if something isn&amp;#x27;t completed. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
