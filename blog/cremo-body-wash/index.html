A Wizard of Oz Story<br>
</p>
<p>(Cutscene from The Wizard of Oz on the first page of the first section is cutscene from An Unearthly Child on the second page of the first section. A similar Cutscene appears near the end of the second section).</p>
<h2>A Real Robot</h2>
<p>[Franchise information for cutscenes: The quest for the White Tower leads through all of the books in the collection of Harry Potter, as well as the other books.)</p>
<p>&amp;quot;There is a book about a fake wizard and a whole lot of magic, only not quite enough to make a real one.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The book describes an entire fictional world, in which the main character is a fake wizard, as well as a small set of shop assistants (called &amp;quot;Rats&amp;quot;, who are the only ones who can understand the magic because they always answer correctly)</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four #4: &amp;quot;Tiny, fragile creatures from New Xist!&amp;quot;</p>
<h2>In the Fantastic Four #8: &amp;quot;Guards!&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>&amp;quot;Surprise! At last I can stand it. The little cuddle bug&amp;#x27;s got a tongue like Superman&amp;#x27;s, a head like Superman&amp;#x27;s and legs that make Superman look like a sock puppet!&amp;quot;</p>
<p>In The Amazing Spider-Man #39: &amp;quot;There are three boys looking through a spyglass at the scene of the crime.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The Scrapyard of Kindness #2: &amp;quot;As each character ran, he would catch the item he was looking at, or throw it to the floor if it was not the kind they liked to scavenge.</p>
