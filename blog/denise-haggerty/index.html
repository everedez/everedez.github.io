<h1>Denise Haggerty</h1>
<p>As a student of biology, I am always a bit curious as to how hard it is to follow a living organism in action. The mystery of how animals operate is what got my interest. I&amp;#x27;ve been drawn to biology in part because I am a fan of nature documentaries and therefore have observed many amazing animal behaviors on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the subject, animals are a very short-lived group of organisms that perform similar functions to one another. They are similar because they share common evolutionary ancestors and exhibit similar behaviors. However, they are different because they are a different group of organism entirely depending on the amount of DNA in the cells. What would one expect to find in a taxonomical history book? Not much since it is a constantly evolving set of adaptations. To find similar elements from an evolutionary standpoint, you look for the same two things that are unique to the members of your chosen group. One of these elements is the DNA.</p>
<p>DNA is the most abundant and the most crucial part of life that is passed along to its siblings. In other words, the DNA is what we are.</p>
<p>Does the DNA of every single one of your cells have the potential to be a living entity? Well, yes, we do. Since we are a life form, the DNA is what we are, the DNA we have to be. You may have seen DNA in science class as a molecule that carries genetic information of an organism. Most people are familiar with the abbreviation &amp;quot;DNA&amp;quot; which stands for DNA.</p>
<p>The DNA is our genetic material that is passed down. How do you get a copy of DNA in your body? There is a method you can use called somatic cell nuclear transfer. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is an exact replica of a cell in your body. In the process, the original cell dies and the new one is formed.</p>
<p>Cell replacement occurs in your body when the original cell dies, and is replaced by a new one. We can do this because we have something called an egg cell, and that egg cell can start working at the very beginning of its life. The entire process is called the process of meiosis. Meiosis is the process of double-helix DNA double-helix formation. The process occurs when a female cell mistakenly gets an extra set of chromosomes instead of using either mitosis that serves to separate chromosomes into two separate pieces.</p>
