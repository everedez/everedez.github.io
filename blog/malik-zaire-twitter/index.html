<p>If you want to be completely useless and walk around aimlessly like a zombie until one day you slip into a coma, you can go right ahead! It’s an awesome game and a neat one at that, with your basic ability being the ability to cause one of the 4 creatures with a tingle to paralyze themselves and leave them immobile for 24 hours to the point that they’ll stay that way, paralyzed until their owner can cure them, or until they die themselves.</p>

<p>What? Seriously? This isn&amp;#x27;t the most relaxing murder mystery game ever or whatever, is it? Why? Hmmm...interesting idea...why?
