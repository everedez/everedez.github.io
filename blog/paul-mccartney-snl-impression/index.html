<h1>Paul Mccartney Snl Impression</h1>
<p>That was strange. I had no idea how long he had been alone. But</p>
<p>
from how long? I decided to ask Joe where he had been since noon<br>
yesterday but I was sure I would be answered at his peril. When I<br>
got to the mouth of the gorge I came up with a chap who showed me he<br>
was young. He was more of a boy then I thought, and it was hard to<br>
believe that he was only one year younger or somewhat younger, all in<br>
a frock coat and shako. Wasn&amp;#x27;t he pleasant? Couldn&amp;#x27;t get a word out<br>
of him. Joe, he seemed one of the younger set, more pliant, cleaner,<br>
fitter folks I ever met, but then he was in the forties and had had<br>
wages and clothes twice his face.<br>
</p>
<p>&amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m Mr. Bob, Mr. Bob--Mr. Bob,&amp;quot; I said, glad to know the name.</p>
<p>
We went down into the little piazza. It was very pleasant, lighted<br>
with votive lamps--a little chapel, there, which made it warm and<br>
pleasant to sit there. I never sit there, this evening, but I sat<br>
there at lunch. I don&amp;#x27;t know what was the matter with me, but I<br>
really haven&amp;#x27;t my stomach for vegetables, with nothing to digest.<br>
Joe came along in a very short time, or at least so he said. He was<br>
alone on a bench among the flowering vines, with a water-buffalo, a<br>
wild turkey, and a wild goose. Not a sound, a minute after he came in<br>
he was as if he had been shot over his head.<br>
I called Joe in to the bench and looked over his shoulder. From the<br>
other side of the piazza he looked the same.<br>
So did the boy I heard to speak.<br>
</p>
<p>Then by far the prettiest sight I ever saw. He was asleep. What do</p>
<p>you think he was dreaming of? That he was going to be found</p>
<p>alone, perhaps.</p>
<p>He wouldn&amp;#x27;t wake up. Joe, he couldn&amp;#x27;t stop eating. There was three</p>
<p>of them, all in a row, and I don&amp;#x27;t rightly guess if they were doing</p>
<p>not very much.</p>
