First, I want to take this opportunity to wish my friends, TGM readers and the studio staff and cast members the greatest success during the first year of the show, and everyone who is involved in the journey of filming each episode and then bringing that vision on to the screen. What a fantastic start.
Lastly – in the coming episodes of The Force Awakens we’ll be filming again with the entire Millennium Falcon, in addition to filming some of The Last Jedi as well.">

<p>First, I want to take this opportunity to wish my friends, TGM readers and the studio staff and cast members the greatest success during the first year of the show, and everyone who is involved in the journey of filming each episode and then bringing that vision on to the screen. What a fantastic start.</p>
<p>Lastly – in the coming episodes of The Force Awakens we’ll be filming again with the entire Millennium Falcon, in addition to filming some of The Last Jedi as well. We’ll be shooting on location at P-Fab, the legendary armory and storage facility located on the outskirts of Downtown Disney. This year we have the good fortune of shooting outside again during the day, utilizing the fantastic environmental options; sound, lighting and the abundance of natural light. If we were shooting in the dark we’d be playing with ideas like how to shoot in depth.</p>
<p>I’m sure there will be more in the future, from our many collaborators and all the fans of Star Wars to talk to each other. Now, what comes next for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi? I’ll let you in on what we know and what The Last Jedi will be doing in the future. But before that, I want to wish everyone a very happy new year and a fantastic 2019!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has made the first year of The Force Awakens and the whole season so incredible to film and shoot.</p>
<p>The Last Jedi (Netflix, Season 1, 2018): The Last Jedi opens with the voices of Qui-Gon Jinn and Ahsoka Tano and will comprise 18 episodes. Four new cast members joined the film and the show’s theme music will be performed by Grammy-nominated Christian musician Toby Gad (formerly of KISS). The film will be the second spin-off from The Mandalorian and may come after an adventure series.</p>
<p>It’s also 2018 and, as we’ve recently discussed at TGN, that was the Year of The Last Jedi, with an impressive production and so much great excitement.</p>
<h2>What’s Next for 2017?</h2>
<p>Just as there’s so much going on in the realm of The Last Jedi, Episode IX and the Han Solo film, there’s going on in the world of Star Wars.</p>
