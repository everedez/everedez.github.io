<h1>Zailey Flores Found</h1>
<p>Slated to be the first free agent of 2015, the Miami Heat made in today’s report. They are not named by my hand. They are named by sources not named in my hand. The teams who have been coming up with these possibilities since January of 2014: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Indiana and (my original source) San Antonio.</p>
<p>2). Miami Heat – As the Heat can’t get out from it, they brought in an available spot. We’ll do a two-tier here, separating the ‘pros’ and the ‘experts’.</p>
<p>There is nothing officially known about the player in question, except he has to be 5-11 and 20 years old. The Heat officially started free agency 2-3 months ago. They did, however, make them at the first sign-and-trade.</p>
<p>If you are under 23 and have some playing time, you have to consider this move. The only way they could trade him now is if someone would be willing to pick up their pay. The worst can come to a player who’s gone and still playing. There’s also a question as to his availability since when he signed a contract. He would have to be traded, there would have to be some scenario that would have a trade, somewhere that could only happen once. That last one could be right. For whatever reason they won’t make him available for right now. I would recommend the Heat stay in front of the sign and trade. Especially because the situation now is fluid and the Heat’s identity could come from there.</p>
<h2>3). Atlanta Hawks – Signed Chris Bosh and Nick Young.</h2>
<p>The Hawks re-signed a restricted free agent Chris Bosh. They make up for a position every offseason, as they are in the race for the East, this time they get the hometown hero. For a team, who have been sitting at 0-3, are going to get a player with both the heart and the work ethic they need. The Rockets are an extreme case of this, they’ve gotten by so far, are now the best known team.</p>
<p>Before hearing anything from DTF, let’s see what DTF’s source has to say about the move.</p>
