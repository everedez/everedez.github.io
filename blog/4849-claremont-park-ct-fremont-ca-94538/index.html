<h1>4849 Claremont Park Ct, Fremont, Ca 94538</h1>
<p>Not recommended for minors.</p>
<p>We had used the number for a year back. I was unaware that there was already a unit in this address until a few weeks later when the phone was picked up. I proceeded to tell her that I had moved on, and that it was time for a trip to her new place.</p>
<p>Instead, my contact insisted that we go to the unit that was currently listed at the same address. When we entered that unit, the lady proceeded to tell us that it was too far to drive, so that she would have to call her manager. After speaking with her, we wound up driving the several miles to the unit in a U-Haul truck.</p>
<p>From her voice mail, we were told that it was much too hot to work outside.</p>
<p>This was surprising news to us given that we did some outside work as city employees as well as students. If this was their only option, we were concerned we would not be allowed to do our jobs if they were short on protective gear. We decided to check out the unit after hearing what the lady had already indicated about that side of the plant.</p>
<p>We were shown to a meeting room with no heat. Our manager came to the door, and she asked us if we would like to go to the private conference room where they had private air-conditioned meetings. We were confused; our manager was behind the desk when we entered, and we were not familiar with this place. We assumed that this was where they took people who had been issued summer wear and had permission to do so.</p>
<p>The woman (same woman in the photos) wanted to take us to the conference room, but our manager said that if our unit was above the desk we would have to leave. We did not know why the manager was being so difficult.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the meeting room, the room was a dead-end. Once in the conference room, we were given a plastic sheet for our protection, with little information what to do in the case of an emergency. We were then met by an associate with a clip-on flashlight. She told us that we were to carry our items with our belongings attached to the outside of our shoulder pads. She would have removed them when we arrived at the meeting room.</p>
