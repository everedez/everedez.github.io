<h1>West Memphis Ar I40 Yesterday</h1>
<p>Wash, East Memphis, I40 from Atlanta</p>
<h2>Ar 571</h2>
<p>A Mississippi River flood control project has been put on hold without being completed. Along with a delay in transporting flood control materials to the area, the Mississippi River will likely swell due to snow and ice melt. As the water rises, more flooding will likely occur along the river as flood waters flow back out of the Mississippi River during the spring thaw.</p>
<p>Over 100 people are reported to have been killed and several hundred have been displaced as the floods sweep through the flood-affected communities. Communities are expected to see large river releases next month following a series of floods across the South.</p>

Gonna have to check here for an update and there will be a lot of text written.<br>

<p>Just fyi, I am pulling a &amp;quot;rain of frogs&amp;quot; too. Hope it rains enough. The 1st load of my boxes got here today, and at least half have to be loaded and unloaded. The other half-soaked now. :(</p>

<h2>Today and Tomorrow:</h2>
<p>I am heading back up the Mississippi River to see how the water is holding up. Fingers crossed for no more flooding. I am also bringing in some time to mail a couple boxes of my china. Thought I had not had any rain for at least a month, as last several weeks have been miserable with flash floods. Like yesterday the flood waters had rolled right across large sections of Interstate 40 (see #5 in my last post), and even flooded into Brays Ferry on the I40 at the end of Hurricane Katrina. So far the water level looks to be holding up, though one has to wonder if an inch or two more would tip the water over and/or wind come into play with the rain. Hope the forecast is wrong and lets start to dump as much as we can at this point. I&amp;#x27;m at a &amp;#x27;D&amp;#x27; for that reason too.</p>
<p>See my last post for a recap of flooding in Mississippi. Just by knowing what I&amp;#x27;ve seen so far, I am hoping there could still be more water in the Mississippi at these levels.</p>
