New guys, veterans, and former regulars from NA LCS Summer Split don’t get sent to LCS unless absolutely necessary. Many teams rely on those players to be good while others can find ways to get better without worrying about the level of competition.

<p>One of the biggest variables to a new team’s success is the amount of time they have under their belt and what they are surrounded by. Every team has different aspects to consider when deciding how much time they need for a new team to become a full-fledged force in the standings, and a new team based on how the previous two teams performed this offseason is no different. In this post, we are taking a look at new strategies for new teams looking for a squad that will act as a long-term foundation to build upon.</p>
<p>1. Starting a team to compete at a higher level should be done after playing and practicing with some of the veteran players from the previous team so that they are prepared for the constant competition every game. For example, if the new team is the current #1 seed in Group B with 15 points after 12 games with a roster starting the season with the best player available, then some of the veteran players that they will take on to prepare for matches against the new squad will include veteran players from the previous team, who have also performed the best against the competition. That will give the team the needed experience to prepare for more upcoming matches.</p>
<p>In this scenario, there are two ways to guarantee additional support in the team:</p>
<p>Utilizing top tier veteran players that have competed in at least some major tournaments and have had a chance to be tested at the end of the season by teams’ top star players. The second, and easiest way to implement this in a new team would be to create some of the best players in the current meta and bring them on as coaches to help.</p>
