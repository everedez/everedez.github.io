<h1>Weather Trumansburg Ny</h1>
<h3>July 14, 1928</h3>
<p>[Editor&amp;#x27;s note: This item was written by a man whose life was changed by the YMCA in Southern California. He is the father of the men who sponsored this article, but, more importantly, to the men and children of Trumansburg, TN, who have been hit directly and hard by the early spring cold of 1928.]</p>
<p>We have had a slight sign of rain for two or three days. I was out this morning and about half past eight I got down to the river and as I was about to come in saw the tide was coming in and the current making eddies to keep it back or so I thought. As I walked down to the water and took my bottle of water from the ice box and filled it I was almost knocked down by a cold south-west breeze. I immediately called for my father and another fellow I knew, both strong and healthy looking men. When they came I asked them why my bottle was full and they replied that it was full of a water that the ice had frozen solid and it was used to drink. All at once the wind stopped and it poured down cold and I thought &amp;#x27;where will I ever get it to drink!&amp;#x27; I turned round and saw I had got my mouth full of water and immediately walked back up and with my father down to the river, put some in his bottle and drank it off - as fast as I could and we soon afterward started back, getting the wind behind us and our tongues loosened. The next day we went in to the car and as the wind came up out of the river we went out onto the sand bank where it was waist deep. At once I made up my mind that I must have a glass of water or I must go to bed and lose weight! I was about five feet three my father was about five and a half feet nine inches tall, broad and strong looking. I had to have the water. I got out of the car, put my bottle of water in my pocket, wrapped my jacket round me and wandered up and down about six feet looking for it and gradually my thirst got worse but in vain. I couldn&amp;#x27;t even feel the side of my bottle as if it touched me.</p>
