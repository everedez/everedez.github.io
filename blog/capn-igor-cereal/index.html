<h1>Capn Igor Cereal</h1>
<p>A small company in Ukraine named Ocobožnyk is making a type of porridge that boasts the quality. The dish is their own creation, but many porridges from every possible source, and the brand name tells us all. In terms of taste, the product appears to be something similar to a porridge you would have to shovel into your mouth a mere 10-15 times, it passes so quickly, and it seems so incredible. This is the kind of the porridge called ‘ocobosrazan’ that Russian media has been feeding children since 2006…</p>
<p>We are a bit vague about the ingredients now. But the ingredients were all sourced from the Russian market, and it is understandable that they decided to change the recipe when the brand spread to Ukraine. We saw it explained during the course of the documentary (there are official claims for the event, but no actual footage). And we can’t even confirm the exact amount of the all important rice used in the recipes, but we would assume there will be quite a bit…</p>
<p>So… we now know that there is a brand in Russia that has created a completely new, homemade breakfast cereal that is more of a sensation. We are far from the US, Sweden, New Zealand, etc, but we are starting to get curious, and we still don’t know what kind of cereal it is.</p>
<p>Now, we cannot touch this any further, because we have not even been able to get details about the brand or the new breakfast cereal yet. But you can find our complete review of the Porridge Ocobožnyk on our Pinterest feed.</p>
<p>Now, the company tells us they only made 15,000 tonnes of the rice; in Ukraine – a huge amount. But even today it seems inconceivable to us that a Ukrainian company only put such an amount into the product over three years.</p>
<p>Ocobožnyk also claims this is “one of the most reliable” porridges commercially available. And it is more “amazing” and “different” that the porridge in Ukraine…</p>
<p>Are you talking about porridges from other countries, like wheat? Because there’s no such thing. It doesn’t matter: for all we know their best porridge comes from Belarus or the Ukraine.</p>
