<h1>Ned Ryerson Meme</h1>
<p>Ned Ryerson’s Facebook was busted by a website called The Onion in 2016. It posted a photo of him with a black hoodie, heavy makeup and his tattoos showing several different characters around his neck. Two weeks later they found he was back and is selling a ticket to see his performances. He told KTLA News, “People love seeing my tattoos.” They found that his Facebook page already had 11,846 likes. He says the true story of his career is “My third knee replacement” because he hadn’t been able to get a tattoo artist to color one in.</p>
