<h1>Cars Weighing Over 6000 Lbs</h1>
<p>While the rise of so-called electric vehicles has the potential of providing a ready-made solution to our current petroleum demand, the role of the government, and specifically government authorities on the procurement side must take into account the significant weight of vehicles, such that we do not need to get involved in their procurement. Fortunately, there is wide acceptance of Tesla’s electric motor being powered by a combustion engine.</p>
<p>To demonstrate just how weighty a motor need be to meet the United States driving power ratings, we can consider that the Chevrolet Volt’s propulsion system is between 5500 lbs and 7000 lbs. In other words, it is like launching the payload the Nissan Leaf, which is 1,600 lbs. Compared with Ford Fusions and Toyota Corollos, the Volt is significantly more responsive and powerful, and has a range over 40 miles.</p>
<p>However, a motor over 6000 lbs is much heavier than the average American home. Then there is the issue of fuel economy and the use of gasoline versus electric fuel. The Volt’s manufacturer has stated that its fuel economy is 29 miles/gallon. With typical electric car specifications, we consider that one US gallon would equate to 472 miles. With gasoline, that figure is anywhere from 400 – 450 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Given that the Model S averages about 13.3 mpg, and is normally powered by Gasoline, while the Leaf currently puts out about 12.0 mpg on gasoline, and puts out about 8.3 mpg on electricity, compared to either a Chevy Volt or Honda Civic LEAF, then the Volt is certainly not a revolutionary fuel economy option.</p>
<p>Though it is lighter and lower power than the Leaf, we still have much longer lifecasting time which may preclude some long range driving adventures thanks to its extra weight. A hybrid vehicle like the Tesla Model X is like a total power tank considering that it has a 500kw range and an electric motor that is responsible for 80% of its power. The base Model X is scheduled to attain 35 miles per gallon in such a hybrid configuration, and has an expected 26 miles per gallon gas economy in a comparable configuration.</p>
