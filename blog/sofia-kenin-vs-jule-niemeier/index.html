1) Sofia Kenin is a Hollywood mega-star with the money and power to name the heir.

<h1>Sofia Kenin Vs Jule Niemeier</h1>
<p>
Sofia Kenin LIVES?<br>
Who owns her $100 million fortune? And how much is she making on the way?<br>
1) Sofia Kenin is a Hollywood mega-star with the money and power to name the heir.<br>
</p>
<p>She will earn from $500,000 to $1 million per film and career. The royalties don’t matter since she is the wife of the billionaire and holds his wealth in trust for her family. Kenin lives in Italy and Germany and only recently received a luxury villa in Paris.</p>
<p>2) Does she have an estate? Who is managing that?</p>
<p>Kenin has an old-fashioned will that gave her a bequest to Kama Sutra, a Buddhist school established in India around the beginning of the 18th century, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “Kenin will leave $100 million to a non-family and a trust,” according to it. Then the trust will enjoy the money for 10 years, after which she will turn it over to Kenin’s family.</p>
<p>A trust for her children has nothing to do with the will. Hollywood magazine recounts Kenin’s testimony that they are not interested in money for their children but instead want to create a global community.</p>
<p>3) Kenin’s fortune isn’t inherited.</p>
<p>Her inheritance doesn’t exceed $100 million as her father will leave an after-tax inheritance worth $2.65 billion to his children in trust. That means the amount she’s going to take from her father — and not the money from her film deals — equals $2.65 billion as well. However, as the Hollywood Reporter describes: “She states that if she dies without leaving a will, ‘I will split the estate equally among my children’ - it would leave $2.65 billion to each child.” So how much Kenin will receive from this new inheritance? It could reach $5 billion which means Kenin would be the third of the nine heirs to her father’s estate to receive this much.</p>
<p>Kenin and her father were childhood friends. Kenin attended the Academy Awards as a member of the American Ballet Theatre until 2007.</p>
