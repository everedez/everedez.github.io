<h1>Bonbon Blitz</h1>
<p>The Bonbon Blitz: The Tour De Taiwan started on October 23, 2017, and finished on November 8, 2017. The Blitz format includes many classic events, which have two races of 25 miles each, plus cross-country and shorter events, to end in a long and storied finish. The Blitz also includes many other events which are smaller races. These races and events include the following.</p>
<p>The Blitz format is an added opportunity for fans to sign up to attend the events, or to provide racing results. Once participants sign up to the race they have access to ride in the event from the starting gate to the finish line, where racing results are available to the public. There is a maximum of five people per team, or group of 5-10. There is one pair permitted per team in the Classic Races.</p>
<p>Tasmanian Cycling Association holds its own, and participates in the Blitz.</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<p>1. Attract a large number of participants who can sign up via racehub.net, while also raising awareness of the event.<br>
2. Demonstrate that Tour de Taiwan has a big-time field of racers able to win with their ability, skills, and experience, combined with a well-prepared base of &amp;quot;overachievers&amp;quot; from Tasmania.<br>
3. Invite more riders to race and provide them with an opportunity to become a part of history.<br>
</p>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
<p>The rules of the Blitz are created by Tasmanian Cycling Association, who provide the common rules and standards to all the events. The rules have been designed by an independent committee, which also includes a representative from the NZBCA. There are 11 rules of the Blitz, and 7 main sets of standards, the meaning of which will be explained in a later announcement.</p>
<p>Blitz is an all-weather road/hilly bike event, with up to 15 riders per team, depending on the event. The race is open to all age groups, but of particular interest to seniors is the &amp;quot;senior riders&amp;quot; segment which is open to riders aged 60+. There is a strong field of riders in this division, and racing results that will be available for those in the field.</p>
<p>The Blitz has a standard race distance of 50 miles, and includes a five-mile cross-country course.</p>
