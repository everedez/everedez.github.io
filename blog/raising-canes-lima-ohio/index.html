<h1>Raising Canes Lima Ohio</h1>
<p>I will only raise this crop till it is dried. This does not mean that the yield will be reduced.</p>
<p>I am a single male F1 Generation Cross. i am looking for the actual parents, i have 3 brothers and a sister now. They are going to sell the male half of this production with my permission. The mother was an aequitas. I have raised 3 generations of plants except to raise it to maturity for the first time. Most of the plants are going to be of grass type. The plants here are not healthy. I used to be raised in the city and dont have any place to farm now for the past 6 years i have been out with my family. We farm all around us in the city ( in the shade of a plantation) and its hard work. I use the season-to- season method for growing plants and hoping that is going to work out. I usually plant 3 to 4 seeds about every 6-8 years. During the winter when it is even colder than that in the Ohio its just a hard job and one would not want to start into Spring farming. But i think that plant based gardening works for me.... Hope this gets you something.</p>
<h2>Some Feedback:</h2>
<p>Would anyone be willing for it to be set in a pot or container? Please let me know what type of pot or container you might like and I can make it for you from scratch.</p>

<p>&amp;quot;Good afternoon, My name is Brian Jones, I have what appears to be a very rare and unique situation. I am a single male - I will get to that- a male(F) Generation Cross offspring of 1/24 of a meadow grass grown from seeds. I am looking for a good number where mother plant used to grow a meadow grass I now have taken over as the common parent. Because these rare, meadow grass have the seeds for the standard commercial meadow grass we grow in our area. I also have some plants that are commercially grown here. I would like to save this rare meadow grass. I would like it to grow to about 7-8&amp;quot; tall, I would like it to bloom most of the summer time.</p>
