Gypsum Simmons is the newest member of the cast of House of Mouse, and I learned this fact when she was announced as a guest on my podcast, How old is Gypsum?!!
The Internet confirmed for everyone the incorrect age-range for Gypsum. The podcast was hosted by Brian Gross, and when it was finished, he directed me to a picture of Gypsum in the article. I was able to con my way into an actual age match by printing out the age I believe Gypsum is purported to be in her debut feature, The House of Mouse and finding a photo of her growing up in that picture.">

<h1>Diggy Simmons Age</h1>
<p>How old is Gypsum?</p>
<p>Gypsum Simmons is the newest member of the cast of House of Mouse, and I learned this fact when she was announced as a guest on my podcast, How old is Gypsum?!!</p>
<p>The Internet confirmed for everyone the incorrect age-range for Gypsum. The podcast was hosted by Brian Gross, and when it was finished, he directed me to a picture of Gypsum in the article. I was able to con my way into an actual age match by printing out the age I believe Gypsum is purported to be in her debut feature, The House of Mouse and finding a photo of her growing up in that picture.</p>
<p>When I obtained the photograph of Gypsum and the age she is meant to be, I then sent the print to Gypsum’s official social media accounts and was told she should expect a series of messages from fans. The tweets made it clear that Gypsum will take over as the newest member of the House of Mouse, and she absolutely refused to disappoint them.</p>
<p>One of the Twitter fans who created a campaign to claim Gypsum as the 11th member of the House of Mouse tweeted that she is “11. At 11, I can&amp;#x27;t move,” thus implying that she would have to learn to crawl. “How do you suppose I won&amp;#x27;t get older before getting thrown in the line?” asked someone else, “Because I won&amp;#x27;t.”</p>
<p>The fan that really needs to get this straight is that since they think she is the tenth member of the House of Mouse, Gypsum is apparently not yet “11”. Here’s a website on how to tell the ages of houses, you know? The website also says that the House of Mouse won’t have a tenth member for at least another month before they start all over again, so maybe it’s still not officially “11” and they have more than one?</p>
<p>But an online bio that points to Gypsum as a mere 11 to 12-year-old would seem to imply that she’s already “11.</p>
