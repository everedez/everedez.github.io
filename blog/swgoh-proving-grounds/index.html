<h2>Standard for 2019</h2>
<h3>Last Fall</h3>
<p>Last Fall the Shifter book and the events that have unfolded in the community have seen the foundation of a group of Shifter devotees. Some of these devotees have been committed Shifter followers and have been sharing information among their community and outside their community for many years. Others have been new contributors, forming new community forums and Shifter Blogs to share their knowledge and learnings through their own efforts.</p>
<p>The Shifter book and its content was first released during New Year&amp;#x27;s Day of 2017, although it&amp;#x27;s been a long time waiting since then. This book and the Shifter community that is now represented in the book have really been a part of the Shifter book for the past year.</p>
<p>This fall season brings the time for celebration of the Shifter book and the community that is represented in it. The book will be celebrating its tenth anniversary, with several events throughout the years. Before looking at each celebration, there are a few things to look out for.</p>
<h2>Schedules Of Events</h2>
<p>These are the events that the Shifter community will be celebrating each season with.</p>
