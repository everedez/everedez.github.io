<h2>Capital Market News</h2>
<p>iShares (IFSC)</p>
<p>Shares of iShares (IFSC) have risen sharply over the past 3 years, which is a testament to the substantial difference between rising-stock prices and rising-market valuations. Given the current mix of company names in the space, both stocks and companies have been strong performers. The iShares iIndustries Index ETF (IFSCI) now exceeds 14 times book growth over the past year, up from 9.8 times in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
