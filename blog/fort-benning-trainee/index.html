<p>
Why is it that Americans are so reluctant to admit that they cannot see by<br>
light, even under shelter? Is the light not the gift of God to every man,<br>
where he has no need of it? If man, as he ought to be, had no sight, it<br>
would be another case; surely no man would be blind except where he might go<br>
away to the store and buy something to put upon his eyes. Is not this as it<br>
ought to be? Will not every man have his own share of light to<br>
please him?<br>
* * *<br>
There is a legend with the name of &amp;quot;Benning,&amp;quot; and the legend is so very<br>
strange, so very repugnant and unnatural. It is so utterly false and<br>
impossible and absurd, I must dwell upon it for the truth; but I must do so<br>
for the sake of the wonderful moral truth in it, that a man who may be such<br>
a man as could not see, who must have no sight, is in the capacity of other<br>
men and women--nay, not in the capacity of men and women in general: the<br>
people as a whole. A man, as is so extremely unlikely to be blind, is able to<br>
see with his eyes; and so it is undoubtedly in the case of Benning; to see<br>
in all outward things, by the light of the sun and of the stars, all the<br>
incidents of life and the beauty of her perfections. I can tell you that<br>
what is visible in a narrow corner of a room is all the beauty in that<br>
dwelling-place. I can tell you what other men of the same stamp might see.<br>
These are the pure men of the world, on the most superficial view; you who<br>
have no greater knowledge, or are of a different sect than what they are,<br>
have found out that they see nothing; they see nothing; this is a thing so<br>
terrible that to anyone who sees it he must be silent. You must also see<br>
that such men do not find beauty in the plainest things. Take Mrs.<br>
