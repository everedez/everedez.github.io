<h1>Ovo Nfl Varsity Jacket</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned in other posts, this is the first season of College Football.</p>
<p>As a Georgia fan who has grown up learning the SEC and the conference system, I have become aware of the difficulty of implementing a system of conference supremacy as new groups (and new conferences) have appeared and have replaced old groups.</p>
<p>In a way this is good in that the Conference is finally starting to have its way and will have a complete game played by the traditional big schools, rather than smaller schools trying to fill in the gaps between the powers of their new brethren.</p>
<p>However, if the Conference survives the 2014 season, it is going to get larger than the Conference it currently is. I think some groups are growing and some are more healthy than others.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am going to do a quick review of the two strongest groups — the New and Deviated Conference. When I started this project I thought that I could build this project by analyzing the strength of the groups, but I got stuck pretty quickly on the fact that there was no real balance of strength between the two groups.</p>
<p>I ultimately decided that I didn’t even need to study the strength of the conferences, since the very existence of a Power Five Conference would define how a conference operates. A conference without an adequate Power Five Conference to work with would work at best.</p>
<p>For this year’s project, I decided to focus on the strength of each of the groups as well as the balance between the two. Some observations I made this year will also be useful to me in the future, so I’ll include those below.</p>
<p>New Conference: Well, except for my own group and the Legends, I had heard almost nothing about these in years past — so I decided to give a brief mention. I am not entirely sure what all the membership there is, but last year it went something like the following:</p>
<h2>D.C. Metro/Mon/Okla./Georgia Tech/Va.</h2>
