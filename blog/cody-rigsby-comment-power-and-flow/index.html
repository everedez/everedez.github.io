<h3>John Caulfield The Power Of Flow In The Matrix</h3>
<h3>To Whom It May Concern: Thank You For Visiting All Of Our Films. There Is No Matrix On The Internet…</h3>
<p>Until now. For the first time in history, we have the time to answer. We’re leaving no stone unturned. We are very pleased to announce the announcement that the Matrix will be played in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palladium on Sunday, December 17, 2013. To be exact, at 1:30 PM EST on December 17, 2013 all Matrix fans can catch their favorite movie of all time, THE POWER AND FLOW OF MASSES IN THE MATRIX, on their TV screens for FREE starting at the Palladium, one block from City Hall.</p>
<p>By that time, there will be hundreds of people all around Central Los Angeles who have a Matrix ticket and are proud to visit the Palladium and watch this mat­riel they love to see for FREE. What’s in the box? The Power and Flow of Masses – a huge change in our culture and an inspiring addition to the film’s magical ride.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to bring The Power and Flow of Masses to the Palladium, one block from City Hall,” says Mark Wahlberg, the creative forces behind the film, a six-part documentary about the life and strug of GSK, the world’s first major music patenting company. “We are committed to exploring new ways to tell our stories and sharing our experiences,” he says.</p>
<p>“I am really proud of what our team has already accomplished. We are so honored to share it with Angelenos,” says Grant Heslov, GSK President &amp;amp; CEO. “Together we are excited to present this new version of TPM.”</p>
<p>“TSG fans will revel in the magic of TPM,” says John Caulfield, Executive Producer. “This version presents a definitive and beautiful take on the classic film.”</p>
