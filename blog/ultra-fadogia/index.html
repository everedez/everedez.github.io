<h1>Ultra Fadogia</h1>
<h3>High-performance Formula</h3>
<p>It’s been more than 150 years since the first electric cars were developed in the United States (in 1893 at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri).</p>
<p>This is an exciting time for Formula 1, and with technological advancements coming at a stunning pace, it’s easy to believe that by this century’s end we will be producing road cars as well as cars that can compete in the highest performance races in the world.</p>
<p>Currently the top category of Formula 1 is known as the World Endurance Championship, having already been won by a Mercedes driver on Tuesday, January 2nd. The last years of the championship saw not only a new formula introduced in Formula 2, but also the creation of a group of teams, in a big way, at the end of this season.</p>
<p>This year, with Abu Dhabi’s spectacular “ACE” circuit, Bahrain as an opportunity for the Bahrain Grand Prix and, Germany’s Hockenheimring circuit becoming a huge success, Ferrari is back.</p>
<p>Formula 1 is still shaping up to be a very competitive category and we have just come out to what can be a very exciting car racing season.”</p>
<p>The season is, as always, full of ups and downs because Formula 1 is one of the biggest events in the world – there are huge international payer markets.</p>
<p>As always a very intense season it was a chance to explore the sport further in more dynamic conditions in the UK. “A visit to Formula 1 can bring almost anything to the fore but the thrill of racing like Formula 1 is at the heart of the weekend” concluded Tony Richardson in a Guardian article.</p>
<p>The strongest of the weekend was the German Grand Prix, which produced results that were nothing short of impressive, even by current world standards. Overall our victory and so many others over the past months, can well be considered the “hardest” of them all.

<p>The win over Mercedes was due to some last minute changes for qualifying not long before, there was a 0.</p>
