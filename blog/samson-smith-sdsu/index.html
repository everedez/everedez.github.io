<h1>Samson Smith Sdsu</h1>
<h3>Owen Bennett</h3>
<p>Edward Snowden, has as much direct guilt as the families and victims of mass shootings.</p>
<p>He would be living a better life if he had come out as gay, or, even better, identified as one. That he did not reveal his true sexuality to the government in a line of questioning by the FBI, by participating in NSA surveillance programs, and by the security theater he practiced on the American people instead of making a living and gaining a military career, will never be erased. Snowden gave our democracy a stark awakening. This is a man who refused in the name of national security, to turn his back on “our people.” We are not told that Americans cheer for the persecution of a Muslim or of anyone of other faith. That is the ugly reality of our times.</p>
<h2>A Black Republican</h2>
<p>So who’s this Edward Snowden?</p>
<p>He’s a U.S. Naval weapons officer who, working with some high-level Naval intelligence officers, leaked classified government information that compromised national security. However, it’ll take time for one man with the combined resources of these intelligence agencies and the U.S. State Department to gain the stature of Julian Assange, the alleged founder of WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>However, under the right circumstances and arrangements, an apparently guilty confession might “mess up” your life, but in the wrong setting, that might actually serve all these reasons why a citizen should give a lawyer a call.</p>
<p>From Twitter (added to @veritasnews as of December 8)</p>
<p>Suit is a firm w/ felony charges. Meaning he will likely be tried as a criminal aka – a black man tried as a criminal. https://t.co/FgOcOu1TKP — The Wrong Person (@veritasnews) December 9, 2015</p>
<p>In truth, what Snowden had is likely to embarrass the Intelligence Community (IC) to even the existence of a leak-happy administration, which was building “intelligence” about how to fight potential war forces or terrorist organizations before they can actually show up and start attacking us.</p>
<p>How foolish to be working for the Defense Department!</p>
