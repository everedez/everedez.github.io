<p>New York Rangers prospect Michael Hutchinson signed a two-year entry-level contract with the Rangers, and will receive AHL level playing time on the road.</p>
<h2>*Click Here to Discuss Potential Contract Extension With Michael Hutchinson</h2>
<p>New York Rangers prospect Michael Hutchinson is continuing the ongoing personal relationship that he established with the Rangers organization through his NHL caliber play in the 2015-16 season. Two days ago, Hutchinson made the move to a multi year, two way contract extension with the New York Rangers and he is beginning to reap the dividends of this latest signing. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;ve been building my game up all summer, and from the off I had to go, I had to get serious and dedicated to my training and to the game,&amp;quot; said Hutchinson. &amp;quot;And it&amp;#x27;s not always going to be just in the summer I love that hockey. After I hit that big break for my senior year, I wouldn&amp;#x27;t have been able to make a full commitment (to hockey). Going to college and taking a year off and being very focused and dedicated, I&amp;#x27;ve been able to continue in my hockey career and make me the player I am today.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>This all begins with a new normal for a hockey professional.</p>
<p>Hutchinson began his year-long stint in 2015-16 with Utica Comets of the ECHL. During that year, Hutchinson signed the best contract in the AHL. He set career highs in scoring, assists, and points which lead all AHL rookies and led the AHL rookies in goals, assists, points and plus plus rating. The goal, assist and point totals are somewhat of a new low for the entire league, but the scoring was high enough that it was enough to earn Hutchinson a post season tournament appearance. When he earned AHL playoff points, Hutchinson was second in the AHL in scoring, tied for second most in points and finished the season with three goals, eight assists, a team leading 36 points (17 goals, 23 assists) and won the ECHL scoring title for the third straight season. Hutchins ended his season by adding a team leading 19 goals in ten games.</p>
<p>In his second season with Utica, Hutchinson continued his 2013 growth. He finished the season with more than two goals and five assists in just over twenty games. He increased his points total to 19 as well.</p>
