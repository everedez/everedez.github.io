Shiyao
A very powerful and unstable young woman (Chi-Hong) that is trained to be an elite warrior. She usually comes out in different combinations from her weapons based off of what she sees as her &amp;quot;talents&amp;quot; in training in a slightly different route that requires the most skill she can muster.

Shiyao<br>
</p>
<p>A very powerful and unstable young woman (Chi-Hong) that is trained to be an elite warrior. She usually comes out in different combinations from her weapons based off of what she sees as her &amp;quot;talents&amp;quot; in training in a slightly different route that requires the most skill she can muster. Her weapons mainly includes her katana, daggers, and swords, in each of which she can wield up to an unarmed strike. However, she is very vulnerable to magic as well, and will use her power during fights to slow down enemies and deal damage to them, but which ultimately does little to the enemies or defending party. She is the embodiment of the hero Shiyao, a young, strong, and capable woman, who must always stand strong and be wary of her enemy.</p>
<p>A second, and much more powerful, opponent from her training. With her katana and dagger at her disposal, she will cast major curses, both with great results and terrible ones. There is also an earthmote that she is constantly following and praying over the team, a bit like a cloud, that she can effortlessly cut down.</p>
<h2>Keima</h2>
<p>A young and capable ranger. Keima has a tall and very slender height, and he has the kind of strength that would be just that but for the fact he is always doing something, but he does have more of a &amp;quot;get ahead&amp;quot; sort of personality. He is also extremely good at hand to hand combat, and is also skilled with a bow.</p>
<p>His actual training is more intense as compared to how he appears on the surface, and he is able to counter much larger foes by using his arm and weakly and very slightly by being up close. He has a fiery aura that helps in fighting against most opponents with equal force. He is very much like both Jang In-goo and Shiyao, who share characteristics such as having a strong bow and skilled with a knife.</p>
<p>An enemy that Keima deals with before beating her. She will teach him a variety of curses or bring spells of destruction on him. She appears only as a vision in her own mind for only a brief moment before disappearing.</p>
<h2>Shima</h2>
<p>The last member on the team.</p>
