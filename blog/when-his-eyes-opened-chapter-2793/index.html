<h1>When His Eyes Opened Chapter 2793</h1>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>He took a deep breath as he paused on the path outside of the library, steeling himself from the abrupt change of scene.</p>
<h2>Nothing. Nothing.</h2>
<p>The air was still warm from the fire&amp;#x27;s fire, the sort of heat that was always giving him a vague unease. The lawn had been mowed and it blazed with the same fire as the house itself, like the glow of the noon day sun breaking through a haze of fog.</p>
<p>His mind swirled in its familiar haze of uncertainty, the usual bits and pieces that went with the rest of his world of fighting against an opponent he had not been able to see yesterday. He shifted in his seat from one foot to the other, as if unsure of just where to put his hands. He wasn&amp;#x27;t sure why he did that. Why not just fold them into fists and dig them in to keep his hands still, as if to keep himself from feeling like him in that spot was a different battle.</p>
<p>But that wasn&amp;#x27;t how his brain was functioning and his opponent felt all too natural. He was thinking about how he&amp;#x27;d be feeling if he were to shift the sword&amp;#x27;s weight away from his hand and point it in his own direction, to throw them in their opponent&amp;#x27;s direction.</p>
<p>Or, no...He was thinking about how the world would feel if it were to shift right now, his left foot pressed into his body&amp;#x27;s seat, and he was forced to pick up his sword with his remaining right hand again. For some reason that just unsettled him because it was like he was constantly thinking about things and others shifting in the air about his head and the room that occupied.</p>
<p>And then another thought latched on to the back of his brain: Why him? What ever gave him the right? It was like his life was just one big action movie with no real drama to it, no real stakes.</p>
<p>Still, if he could help his girlfriend make it home safe, maybe it was worth it, if he had to do this in the service of someone he cared about, if this was just about him and not love as a result of him being his.</p>
