<h1>Women Misled Menopause</h1>
<h3>How To Spot The Side Effects Of Premature Menopause</h3>
<p>This is a problem many women face. Most women never realise that the health problems and loss of stamina that this leads to, for the duration of their menstrual cycles before menopause happens can become serious and very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Women suffer long-term issues like mood swings, inability to work and physical problems like PMS that they are unaware of because we are so busy monitoring our fertility.</p>
<p>Meds has been the answer all month from Medlinc to put a stop to this. It started off with a limited supply and production in January, when it was launched across UK. Now, it&amp;#x27;s available nationwide, in the new Medlinc EasyEvolver. You need only add a prescription (the same as your passport) to purchase the product.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of these devices, but many women are quick to note the important messages that are apparent through a thorough inspection once it&amp;#x27;s on. So will this help? Can we call this ‘safe’? Let&amp;#x27;s take a quick look.</p>
<p>This very easy system allows you to track your ovulatory cycle, the dates you conceive, and the phases of your cycle as well, if you are a lady with a regular cycle. This can be extremely relevant as well, as it allows a quick identification of your natural cycles. It can be used to predict your fertility so you can start avoiding fertility problems later on in life if needed with certain clients.</p>
<h2>What&amp;#x27;s The Idea?</h2>
<p>The idea here is that every woman can use a calendar to see the new-cycle opportunity coming up. The calendars have new days, and they alert you that they are available. You may then want to put a quick stop on and on and on to check.</p>
<h2>What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>Simply look for the new-day alert to confirm a new cycle could be available, or to see if a cycle is too old. Take our pills (a prescription) or just do nothing, if you want to be safe. If you want to see a more detailed cycle preview but you don&amp;#x27;t have pills, there are 4 ovulation prediction tools that can be installed in your home.</p>
<p>We like it because it&amp;#x27;s hassle free - there is no extra cost.</p>
