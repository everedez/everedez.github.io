<h1>Tina Hertzog</h1>
<p>After graduating from Boise State University, Tina Hertzog worked in various jobs, including a number of off-campus jobs as a teenager.</p>
<p>At the age of 20, Tina got a job as a waitress earning US$9 per hour. (Less time not spent eating and chatting at her work.) She worked several temporary jobs until the year of the 9/11 attacks when she got her first permanent job.</p>
<p>She moved back to the East Coast and worked several odd jobs until 1998, when she came to Los Angeles to pursue a full time career in acting.</p>
<p>Tina auditioned at this point and continued working for a few years, making her famous on many local dramas.</p>
<p>Upon graduating, Tina moved to Seattle, Washington. Tina is originally from California but has lived in Seattle since 1997. Tina is currently in her sixth and final season of Blue Bloods. Tina started out as one of the show&amp;#x27;s most popular actors. She ended that season as one of the show&amp;#x27;s most recognizable faces.</p>
<p>Tina initially performed within the police department (shown below) but got her first taste at S.O.B. (shown above) and then even more with season four. Both of these episodes included Tina as either an extra or a supporting character. She is incredibly versatile and makes her own style of acting, where she can handle being either one or the other.</p>
<p>Tina has been called a very &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; actor. She actually went to the UCLA theater where this is one of her favorite scenes:</p>
<p>Tina is a woman of many faces and people, so what about her famous friends? Here are a few. Tina&amp;#x27;s friend Toni is an original cast member of Blue Bloods and an openly gay man. Tina&amp;#x27;s other friend is the first actress from the San Diego TV series Cheers to come out as gay.</p>
<p>Tina&amp;#x27;s boyfriend has been described as a super cute, rich, wonderful guy by other members of the cast. She plays a gay guy&amp;#x27;s boyfriend on Cheers</p>
<p>Tina also has two great boyfriends with ties to this show that we&amp;#x27;ve recently encountered. One is John Hiers&amp;#x27; friend from Ohio.</p>
