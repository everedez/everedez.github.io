<h1>Igor Zimenkov</h1>
<p>The opinions expressed here are solely those of the individual author(s) and do not reflect the opinions of CBS Inc.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal&amp;#x27;s Philip Ewing is used here in part due to his ongoing interest in politics, but also because of time constraints and his desire to focus on the best bits.</p>
<p>Politics with a capital P: Trump&amp;#x27;s victory</p>
<p>Mitt Romney&amp;#x27;s political ascendancy is the first of five of the first five chapters of America&amp;#x27;s transition from a divided populace to a united majority.</p>
<p>
For a long time, Republican politics has been dominated by an anti-tax, anti-big-business, anti-interventionist wing.<br>
Mitt Romney<br>
History has proven otherwise.<br>
</p>
<p>The President and his supporters were able to extend the GOP&amp;#x27;s now-unbroken dominance by appealing to the self-identified populist base on the one hand and the more traditional party establishment on the other, both of which also benefited from the President&amp;#x27;s former rival, Sarah Palin.</p>
<p>The other half of the establishment is still there, but there are signs that it is a smaller minority now than in the early- to mid-1980s when Ronald Reagan and his massive campaign staff brought down an opposition party that was headed by the notorious Alan Cranston.</p>
<p>For the moment, Republicans are winning hands down in the United States of America.</p>
<p>The difference between today&amp;#x27;s GOP and 1980&amp;#x27;s Goldwater Republicans (who were critical of the GOP&amp;#x27;s support for welfare and civil rights) is that today&amp;#x27;s GOP isn&amp;#x27;t going to let the electorate forget that they were part of the same anti-democratic, anti-American movement that they oppose today.</p>
<p>Democrats cannot win if Republicans remain what they are today.</p>
<p>Republicans, which include both business conservatives and free marketeers, have consistently steered the country to the right on foreign policy, domestic policy and our role in the world.</p>
<p>
They are anti-war, anti-missile defense, anti-immigration, anti-multiculturalism, and open borders.<br>
That is true in the Republican Party as much as it is in the Libertarian Party and the Democrats.<br>
They&amp;#x27;re not enough Republicans to win the presidency, and they certainly are not enough Democrats to win the election.<br>
</p>
