<p>Pliny the Historian used this term for the famous palace complex at Pontus, as the name ΊΣξ was commonly used. The main building consists of a temple complex and later bath-house, with a more elaborate temple on the western wing (there is a temple to Diana). The layout is a vast complex with many buildings.</p>
<p>Details of the Palace of the Great King Eutychus(Pliny the Historian, Vol. 98-103, Book XIV) Pontus, Anatolia, Bithynia, c. 35 - c. 180 BCE. Also recorded in the writings of Xenophon, Strabo, Valerius Maximus, Arrian, Pliny, Diodorus Siculus, and many others. Later copies of the ancient library were incorporated into libraries in Central Asia and Europe, particularly in Islamic Egypt.</p>
<p>By the 7th century, the city was a major cultural center of central Anatolia, with an Islamic cuneiform tradition continued to be popular in Anatolia as well. The Epigraphikion, &amp;quot;Travels in the interior of Anatolia&amp;quot; by Leidig (Cracow 1644) records that the temple of Athena Antaios is in Pontus. More than a hundred inscriptions have been identified from Pontus—many from the 7th century—which survive intact. Most of these are in English, but a few are available in German (arabic and ancient Egyptian).</p>
<p>The city of Ephesus, or &amp;quot;Ephes&amp;quot; (Attika), was founded near the end of the 4th century BCE and at the time of its greatest importance with its temple of Athena (built as early as the 4th century BCE). The city of Ephesus was part of the Seleucid Empire and was the headquarters of the Praetorian Guard. The largest temple in the region is the Olympia, with an original height of 16.5 meters (55 feet), and a present height of 17.7 meters (62 feet). Its hall was a great meeting place.</p>
