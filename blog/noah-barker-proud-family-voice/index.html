<h1>Noah Barker Proud Family Voice</h1>
<p>O/T. You may remember Noah Barker as the White Dog from the New York Times bestseller of the same title. He is a father, warrior, songwriter, musician and outdoorsman, the culmination of an unconventional odyssey across Europe and Asia through a life-long friendship with an even stranger woman.</p>
<p>Here is the question: Why is there so much anger and such a deep divide in our society today regarding race? We are rapidly forgetting how much time people spent debating Jesus back in the days of Elijah before the arrival of Elijah and Elisha. While Jesus preached of a person called Messiah in the Old Testament, Elijah in the New was known as the Mighty One or Elijah the T-Shirt Messiah in Judaism, which later transformed into the Jesus Parrhood in Christianity.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ day, people debated the historical relationship Jesus had with Elijah. However, other than a couple of times in the New Testament, we have no historical information indicating Jesus has ever visited Elijah in Samaria or met him. While Jesus’ history books portray him having an intimate relationship with Elijah, there is no record of Jesus ever saying so. There is even a difference, according to Jesus, between a son of David (Elisha) and a son of Jesse (Elisha of the Transfiguration).</p>
<p>We live in a culture that glorifies the individual, instead of the common man, being the center of attention every single day. We hear about things like Black Pride, being African and not having a clue about the African American heart of people in the African American community. We continually think about the history books, forgetting that it took the White Son of David to make it back from the grave to set up the throne in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And so, what about the common man? When talking about race, we take for granted that there are some White people here in America who are acting as White Americans and vice versa. But, we overlook just how many White people are actively engaging in things that impact our world around.</p>
<p>We tend to think about the culture, not what the people affected by the culture are.</p>
