<h1>Metaltron Xii The True Dracombatant</h1>
<h3>Review By: Vh.beast666</h3>
<p>The biggest advantage Toto got out of his Mini-Witch was for the fact that he could use it to morph into its full size which let’s him get a very good deal at the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of New York. Unfortunately, I’m still not impressed with Toto’s ability to morph in and out of disguises or into a normal human look. This is mostly due to how Toto looks. You can’t really see how it looks unless you open up the eyes. It is so weird looking! He was also at the 30th Annual Battle of Metaltron, but I think this is going to be his last battle. I would like to get an autograph from Toto just to show people how it looks. If only autographs weren’t so expensive and everyone weren’t cheating … it would be so much easier if they just called up someone famous to have their picture taken with their new Pokémon all the time. Don’t you agree?</p>
<p>So, let’s take a look at the True Dracombatant and see how good it is. The good thing is that we have Toto himself doing the review. So just like all anime cels I’ve read, the first thing you’ll notice is the bad part, it is honestly a terrible looking CEL, I hope in the future these guys will just use some Pokémon glass to make it look more well proportioned. The thing is that now there’s very little difference really between having a character from another anime interact with these Pokémon. Who knows, maybe one day we might get a Kecleon-like trainer who has his own Pokémon! As for the Ultra Cels, well, they don’t really offer much that is unique. It’s mostly the little extra to make it stand out and that is about it.</p>
<p>How the Fighting Type moves look</p>
<p>Compared to the Fighting Cels this is a much more flatter, a lot more thickly colored and overall the majority of the body is black, almost like a Pichu/Pyroklep. For a change the mouth looks like a hole.</p>
