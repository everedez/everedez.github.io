<h1>Aduhelm Prescribing Information</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are three meds that can help you manage coughs and colds. If you have any specific questions or symptoms, please consult with your doctor. Do not take these three meds or substances while pregnant.</p>
<h2>Corticosteroids</h2>
<p>Corticosteroids are medications given to boost the immune system and to help with swelling, infection, and headaches associated with colds and coughs.</p>
<p>However, if you want to keep your immunizations up to date and do not have a doctor&amp;#x27;s schedule, you may wish to avoid corticosteroids entirely. In addition, make sure that you take this class of medication in the place where your doctor or other family member might keep it, and do not take this medication while you are pregnant or when nursing.</p>
<h2>Antibiotics</h2>
<p>Although antibiotics are mostly given to treat antibiotic-resistant forms of infections, colds and coughs can damage the nervous system and the internal organs. Therefore, antibiotics can&amp;#x27;t be given to everyone, and you may not get the benefits of this type of treatment.</p>
<p>However, if you do not want antibiotics, you may wish to avoid antibiotics entirely. In addition, make sure that you take this class of medication in the place where your doctor or other family member might keep it, and do not take this medication while you are pregnant or when nursing.</p>
<h2>Probiotics</h2>
<p>Although bacteria themselves might not be good in the respiratory field, your gut bacteria may have a role in the health of your chest and lungs. This type of food can be helpful for these organs and help prevent infections that may occur as a result of a cold.</p>
<p>However, if you do not want probiotics, you may wish to avoid this class of medication entirely. In addition, make sure that you take this class of medication in the place where your doctor or other family member might keep it, and do not take this medication while you are pregnant or when nursing.</p>
<h2>How to Take Albuterol and Other Pregnant Meds</h2>
<p>Albuterol - It is unlikely that your baby will have an adverse effect on your lungs as a result of these pregnancy dosages. However, if a baby should come and see you with colds, this medication is best withheld.</p>
