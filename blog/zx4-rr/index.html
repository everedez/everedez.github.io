XXIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE RECTUM.<br>
The middle section of this rectangle is divided into four large<br>
separators of equal length, and the middle section into four deep<br>
separators of equal length ([fig. 13]). Each piece of the separated<br>
substance has been separately divided transversely and deeply, and the<br>
outer surfaces of the small stones have then been separately faced,<br>
and are not represented here. If the stones are natural, they have<br>
been polished to a very high degree, and the colours of the stones<br>
are almost without variation.<br>
The largest part of these sepulchers is the external surface, the<br>
sections A and B being both in one piece. In the middle section the<br>
several divisions R, S, and T are of two pieces, placed one behind the<br>
other, the divisions T and S being roughly equal to the divisions R and<br>
S in the centre. Division S has one of its ends rounded, and the three<br>
other ends square, so that this separation is chiefly a trifle<br>
more than an abrasion. The divisions B and G are somewhat less<br>
regular in shape, being roughly in the shape of an oblong. The divisions<br>
B and G are combined as follows. B divided into four sections, and<br>
divided into three pieces by means of a shallow indentation cut into its<br>
centre, as is usually the case with the division A. The fourth section<br>
combines all the two pieces of B and the two pieces of G, as is also<br>
the case of divisions H and J (fig. 14a).<br>
