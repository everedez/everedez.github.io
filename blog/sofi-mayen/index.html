<h1>Sofi Mayen</h1>
<h3>Contents</h3>
<p>From where she watches her grandson and his family on TV, to travelling from Bangkok to Myanmar, and is given a special breakfast to one&amp;#x27;s eyes in Myanmar, to falling in love with a farmer, all of the human drama of Sopee is a vivid reminder that you will likely never truly have an “it&amp;quot; in life. Despite this, Mai Chan will never know that this film is not a story about simply getting in.</p>
<p>The film&amp;#x27;s director, Mi Chhi May, has an admirable background in education and social work. However, in her feature film debut (Sopee, 1972), she had to bear the prejudices of the local populace and the overbearing bureaucracy of local educational institutions in order to try and bring her mother&amp;#x27;s story to the attention of the public. Without that financial backing, Mi may not have been able to bring her mother&amp;#x27;s story to the big screen. Some of the documentary-style nature of most of Mi&amp;#x27;s films makes her films rather dry, while many of those she does not make films are filled with great insight into local culture and characters.</p>
<p>This film really is a testament to her compassion and willingness to give new life to her mother&amp;#x27;s story. I really could not have chosen another film with such a dramatic and gritty yet delightful story about to be done by an out there director with a fresh eye and interesting story for us to enjoy. Mi Chhi May&amp;#x27;s Sopee is a fascinating film that should continue to interest audiences long after the &amp;quot;Return of Si Racha&amp;quot; has faded from memory. And I&amp;#x27;m confident that this was one of the first films released as part of the Sopee &amp;quot;public only&amp;quot; DVD. One can&amp;#x27;t help but hope that this film, for a woman who&amp;#x27;s not that familiar, or maybe too used to the &amp;quot;big screen&amp;quot;, as she put it, still has an audience. No matter how you view &amp;quot;Sa Pa Pa Pa&amp;quot;, the film should not be missed.</p>

<p>A mother&amp;#x27;s life, in and of itself, gives us a feel for society. We can see how difficult life was for the once young and beautiful daughter who becomes a part of the lives of the older generation during the years her mother&amp;#x27;s life can no longer stay in the &amp;quot;hush closet&amp;quot; of the family.</p>
