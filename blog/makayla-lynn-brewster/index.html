<h3>18-Nov-2017 - Mike Turner, Birmingham</h3>
<p>“Are there any other people who, at any distance, have known Mike Turner? Is there any other human being whom we know of who would now stand up on any stage and defend this person to anyone who was on trial, public and perhaps even members of the court, in front of the full American Press? I would ask this to his mother, then, not only because I think he would appreciate it, but also to this jury.”</p>
<p>Mike Turner’s lawyer accuses the woman of “cultural appropriation”</p>
<p>Mike Turner’s mother said that she was &amp;quot;thanked&amp;quot; for everything she has done to help her son during his ordeal.</p>
<p>Armed with a powerful case alleging she is a woman who has become an &amp;quot;exact copy&amp;quot; of her son, Anita Turner told supporters at a rally in South Carolina that she feels &amp;quot;thanked&amp;quot; for everything that has unfolded, and &amp;quot;we&amp;#x27;d like to thank Mike for his excellent work in this whole process.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Following intense questioning from the defense, the woman took to the podium and said: &amp;quot;I’m going to ask you to give me a break on this. I have never thought of myself as an African-American, and you’ve all heard things that are trying to grab my attention. My mother is here. I’m going to ask her to give me a break on this.”</p>
<p>Telling the panel about her pregnancy while being arrested in her apartment in Columbia, SC on Thanksgiving, the woman also named her wife, son, daughter and parents.</p>
<p>The woman&amp;#x27;s lawyer Marc Gingras questioned the woman about her past. However, it seems that someone who claimed to be a former lover of Mike and previously was an acquaintance of Anita Turner&amp;#x27;s son, Jason, is the true African-American woman bearing the title of &amp;quot;maternal great-grandmother.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Following the questions from his mother, Gingras delivered a passionate call to arms for the mother of Mike&amp;#x27;s accuser.</p>
