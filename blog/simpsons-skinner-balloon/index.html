<h1>Simpsons Skinner Balloon</h1>
<h3>[via] Instagram (@snkskibalehouse)</h3>
<p>On Christmas morning I feel excited to be a parent, I’m enjoying the Christmas season, watching and enjoying those who come to visit us at the Skinner balloon house. One of the fun things is when Steve decides to carve out some of the balloons he has collected.</p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly what he did or said, but I like that balloon in particular. That balloon is of Steve Skinner.</p>
<p>From then on I start documenting all the balloons that Steve collected.</p>
<p>It makes me start to feel alive knowing I was there when Steve built that balloon. It makes me understand what it means to have dreams as a child.</p>
<p>Every time I photograph one of the balloons that Steve built I let the feeling go in to his memories, it’s almost Christmas like. I wonder where Steve is now, does he dream now like I know? Is he dreaming in this moment and if he did I would too?</p>
<p>Oh, Steve, I miss you already. I really do.</p>
<p>Update – Steve has decided to make a comment on the blog and shared his pictures on his FB page. You can check out his comments here.</p>

<p>
So many years of balloons makes me really happy. More happy than I had ever seen in my life…<br>
Now we are writing about Steve but we will never forget how excited we are for Steve.<br>
Steve is a man of a million dreams and he will never cease to amaze you as you remember him.<br>
