Will Farrell was sitting in his office.
A tall man with blue eyes and thick glasses, a brisk manner and an air that defined him as a man who smoked, Farrell had been called in four days ago and still hadn&amp;#x27;t made his presence known to Burke. &amp;quot;Anything I need to know,&amp;quot; Farrell said just shy of going. &amp;quot;Anything at all.">

<h1>Rickford Burke</h1>

<p>Will Farrell was sitting in his office.</p>
<p>A tall man with blue eyes and thick glasses, a brisk manner and an air that defined him as a man who smoked, Farrell had been called in four days ago and still hadn&amp;#x27;t made his presence known to Burke. &amp;quot;Anything I need to know,&amp;quot; Farrell said just shy of going. &amp;quot;Anything at all.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s going to take a couple of days,&amp;quot; Burke said. The conversation was going fine. It didn&amp;#x27;t need the words &amp;quot;bullying the superintendent&amp;#x27;s daughter&amp;quot; to trip over from his mental checklist.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Then I&amp;#x27;ll talk to you,&amp;quot; Farrell said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#x27;m through with you.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Now, look, I don&amp;#x27;t care what this is about. You know it&amp;#x27;s not true. I&amp;#x27;m just going to go out on a limb here and I&amp;#x27;m just saying it has nothing to do with you. I don&amp;#x27;t think you understand what the impact on your life would be. You&amp;#x27;re not in the superintendent&amp;#x27;s job. And you are in control of your life. You&amp;#x27;re going to have to clean up your own mess. You&amp;#x27;re not going to walk away from this. As I said, it has nothing to do with you. I know what the DA is going to say. It&amp;#x27;s not your business. I mean, it could be, but it&amp;#x27;s not. And you know it.</p>
<p>&amp;quot;Look, I don&amp;#x27;t get bothered by threats, you know that. But you gotta be a big boy. Clear the air. We&amp;#x27;re done here.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Burke crossed the room, calling out in a firm voice, &amp;quot;Be careful. If you don&amp;#x27;t think you are the smart one, then you think you&amp;#x27;ll be the fool for the rest of your life. You&amp;#x27;re putting this together for me. You&amp;#x27;re putting your own life at risk, and you know that. You know you&amp;#x27;ll be painted as a nice guy who&amp;#x27;s not in your right mind unless you&amp;#x27;re a straight man. Now, I gotta know.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Burke was on his knees in Farrell&amp;#x27;s office in front of his desk. He was rocking back and forth. He scooted this way and that for emphasis. Then he moved again.</p>
