<h1>Joker Omb</h1>
<p>After two years and two sequels, Adam writes about his feelings and experiences with the game, his own evolution as a filmmaker, his constant &amp;quot;curvaceous person in some ways,&amp;quot; The Game Awards, and his thoughts on games that are not only awesome, but also very popular in their own right.</p>
<p>The Writer’s Project is a weekly personal diary from the Writer’s Studio. Every week the Writers share what’s been inspired by their personal experience with games, whether real or fictional.</p>
<p>Also known as Adam, Adam Omb is a writer, filmmaker, graphic novelist, occasional humorist, occasional movie critic, and international (under 26) creative force in games criticism. He is a co-founder of Tribeca Film and the owner of GamingAmarity.</p>
<p>I played this game for the first time in 2016. There were a lot of promises made to me back then that I felt, in hindsight, were a bit ridiculous. Most notably being the huge, empty middle third of the game that follows the “I hate sex” part, everything in it feeling dead because of all the sex scenes and ridiculous (perhaps even, arguably, immature) sex talk.</p>
<p>One of the disappointments of the game is that the first time you play it you probably will not even remember how you solved the puzzle of the knife (as I did not even remember how to find the scissors, let alone find the knife), let alone why the original solution was this way. If people at first think it all comes down to the inexplicable and absurdly specific puzzles, they will not understand why you went to all this trouble in the first place, and will probably be fooled by your approach.</p>
<p>The second one is that it is a very repetitive puzzle, as if there is no much real challenge beyond the sheer and total pain of the first puzzle.</p>
<p>I’ll avoid arguing about which of the two is worse, as both are incredibly frustrating, although they may be entirely unrelated to how the game is supposed to be played.</p>
<p>However, I can also’t help not wanting to play as a writer again when I’m watching something so obviously lacking any intelligence or complex thought.</p>
<p>That said, let’s not go on here and talk about my feelings of embarassment.</p>
