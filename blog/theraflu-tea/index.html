<p>Who doesn’t love a fresh cup of tea? So what if the steam isn’t really necessary or if some of your hot tea’s not quite the same as the others? Well, there’s something else people like a bit more besides more boiling tea to do, then: a new toy you might just like?! Meet Super T, a simple vacuum kettle that cooks and cleans teas through its easy-to-use stainless steel vacuum valve, and the incredible steaming power of water… and Tea!</p>
<p>How it works</p>
<p>Developed by Team L, the ‘vacuum kettle’ of Super T was inspired by one of the primary functions of the human body: heating up food to digest, cooking food and drinking tea.</p>
<p>Developed by Team L, the ‘vacuum kettle’ of Super T was inspired by one of the primary functions of the human body: heating up food to digest, cooking food and drinking tea. Since the vacuum valve is just a cylinder vacuum tube, it functions like a steamer and cleans teas just like a water kettle does. The vacuum valve also helps remove the hassle of water cleanup, so you could just wash the rest with your tea instead. The vacuum function is the easiest way to steam and clean any type of tea, without the fuss. The vacuum pump is located on the top where the vacuum tube is, so you only need to open the valve. The water valve is pressurized by steam making it almost instantly operate at anything from 200 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, the sealed lid makes for a good tea experience the whole day long. And there’s even an additional system for transporting your tea out of the bag – simply follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>Protective design</p>
<p>This kettle was designed to work in households with people who tend to linger longer in front of the TV or even with a computer. The included ‘tea bag with insert’ is a sturdy storage container you could use instead of a purse or glove box.</p>
