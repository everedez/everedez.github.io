<h3>2. **The Problem**</h3>
<p>Imagine two people who are conducting some experiments. This person is the first who prepares the DNA sample, which contains a very rare DNA sequence that represents only 11% of the genome. Then it is taken under a microscope, or a set of fluorescent lights, which are then used to spot specific cellular processes. As the person with the DNA of only 11% doesn&amp;#x27;t know what to do with this much DNA, they decide to save the rest of this sequence, which represents 0.7% of their genome.</p>
<p>
2| The DNA of 11%<br>
9| The DNA of 0.7%<br>
16| The DNA of 0.9%<br>
21| The DNA of 0.9%<br>
83| The DNA of 8%<br>
\------| The DNA of 100%<br>
\-----------|<br>
</p>
<p>The resulting DNA sequence will be shorter in length, and consist mostly of the same DNA base pairs with slightly different numbers.</p>
<p>This person considers the idea of finding the DNA sequence with the DNA that represents the most common protein across the known universe. As the person who manages to find this most common protein sequence, their conclusions is: the chances of occurrence of DNA sequence that represents the most common protein is only 0.7%, which is extremely close to chance. (This is about 10%, or almost one chance in 100 trillion.) The idea is very scary and frightening. In the same time, the person who starts the experiment with the DNA sequence with the most prevalent protein has to find out what part of the most common protein was the cause of the most common proteins being found. This should happen within 10 tries. Such a long experimental experience would paralyze or completely prevent the understanding of protein folding itself. A number of people have tried to research what actually happens when the most common protein and the most prevalent protein meet. Theoretically no one realized that there was anything in a protein folding itself. In a weird way, the most common and the most prevalent protein came together quite naturally and spontaneously. It is not the least surprising as well. By their own experiment. They noticed the proteins made up of these common and prevalent amino acids did come together and fold themselves together.</p>
