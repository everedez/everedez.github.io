She is brave, strong, intelligent, and dependable. She has an outlook and attitude that matches with being a good woman. She is funny, always puts on a smile and a friendly face. Not too long ago, she was just a naive student in the first grade! Just like lots of people – there are many first grade students. One day, her father was told that her school had to not teach students that they shouldn’t go out much in order to save their lives.">

<h1>Juanita Omb</h1>
<p>Juanita Omb is a good woman</p>
<p>She is brave, strong, intelligent, and dependable. She has an outlook and attitude that matches with being a good woman. She is funny, always puts on a smile and a friendly face. Not too long ago, she was just a naive student in the first grade! Just like lots of people – there are many first grade students. One day, her father was told that her school had to not teach students that they shouldn’t go out much in order to save their lives. Yet, her dad was a bit strong guy. Then a rumor gets around that she had robbed a bank. Some other students got in trouble with the law. Her parents decided to send her to live in an orphanage with good relatives. She then came to live on her own. After a while, she got married, had some kids and moved to the other side! She then had a child – who also moved to the other side – this time – she got married again. Soon, she had a teenager, who wanted to save a little money and now, they want to live off. But there is no room for anything left in her life. Juanita is still a good woman.</p>
<p>Her dream is to become a mother. She wants to take on care of her children, while she can, from the home.</p>
<p>Naima said to me when we were in Lima. Just like all my students at Grades 7 and 9, Juanita is smart, tough, and brave. She is good looking, too! She has a very, very good figure. And as she said – so does everyone else here. No one comes here and thinks she is plain! People are surprised when they meet her. If you visit her house, she will make you to understand that she is the best person here. She is not here to only talk about her daughter or tell you about her family. Juanita is famous for her house, her husband and his friends. They are all my students at Grades 7 and 9. She has 2 brothers and 4 sisters, all of them are educated in the way that you want to be schooled for. At this moment, there is a problem in their family that they are very weak. I am really proud of this woman.</p>
