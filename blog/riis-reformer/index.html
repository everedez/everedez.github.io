<h1>Riis Reformer</h1>
<h3>Class</h3>
<p>The Riis class underwent extensive tests in July 1817 to measure its merits. Its technical specifications were varied, with a smooth curve enabling a wide range of propulsion-technology designs to compete. As the world&amp;#x27;s first powered ironclad, the Riis was propelled by a rotary steam engine in a shell with a combustion chamber, for propulsion it used a single-pass radial engine. Its armament was the 20-pound cannon. While designed for a war purpose, it was not intended for commerce and thus did not accompany the most successful ironclads of this or any other era.</p>
<p>The Riis was designed to replace frigates, the largest and fastest battle ships that had been built from the 1790s through the early 1840s, including some from earlier ships such as the Ganges and the Black Prince. It formed part of the program to create iron-clad warships for American service during the War of 1812 and served as troop transports for the naval forces that sought to defend New Orleans during the War of 1812. When the War ended at the end of 1814, the ships completed repairs and moved to northern New York bay to stand by to serve in Federal Bureau of Prison ships until the early 1840s. After that, they returned to New York and were assigned to minesweeping duty.</p>
<h2>Riis</h2>
<p>The Riis class was the US Navy&amp;#x27;s most advanced iron-hulled warships that participated in the War of 1812, and were built during the later 18th century:</p>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<h3>Construction:</h3>
<p>Length: 573 feet (180 m)</p>
<p>The Riis began construction at William Dearborn&amp;#x27;s shipyard in New York, New York and was launched in 1820. While the size of this vessel was standardized at, the new ship only had a displacement of. The ship was the largest and most complex ship ever built in America. Its long and narrow triple-hulled hull, its exposed wood covered with iron plating, and its weight contributed to the vessel&amp;#x27;s popularity. This ship was propelled by a steam engine on a single-pass, radially-split cylinder. The vessel&amp;#x27;s range was  and it had a length to width ratio of 3:1. The Riis carried either 8 or 16 guns, depending on the year and design.</p>
