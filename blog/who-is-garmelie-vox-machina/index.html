<h1>Who Is Garmelie Vox Machina</h1>
<p>The actor has been playing the role on screen from 1997 to 2014. Since April 2014 he has returned to the role in the Spanish soap opera “Cajas” (Spanish for “witches”). In 2003 he had a small role in the television series ”Blind”. Since 2014 he has made a comeback in the British action-drama “High Society 3″.</p>
<p>Vox Machina, 47, is one of those rare actors who was really born to play such a role. He was born in 1987 and his parents used to work in a factory in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>“My parents wanted me to come to the United States when I was three to study at the University of Miami.”</p>
<p>His first part of the film career was as a child actor in the 1993 Disney Film “The Iron Giant”. In 2000 he starred in the film “Step”, a black comedy directed by Romain Duris. Back in the early 2000s he could be seen in a short film “In the Sea Zone” directed by Walter Salles and the science fiction film “Everything is Red”, but other than that, his films never earned a positive response from people. In 2007 he starred in the science fiction film “Suicide Squad” along with Samuel L. Jackson, and the same year he was seen in the comedy-drama “Band of Brothers”, directed by Robert Redford.</p>
<p>He came close to getting his big break in the 1997 film that would later become “American History X” in 1998.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted to play the best male role that I could. I had a successful career as a child actor, in that role I played in ‘The Iron Giant’, and I knew that I wasn’t interested in playing the leading male role. I wanted to play the male role that the audience would respect. I was waiting for that to happen.”</p>
<p>He told the audience at the Golden Globe awards, “It was so exciting to participate on the set of such a film. It was amazing.</p>
