<h3>About Me</h3>
<h3>Thursday, June 15, 2016</h3>
<p>Chinese Communist Party veteran and professional critic He Yingnan has expressed a wish to get married before he passes away.</p>
<p>He Yingnan is a retired CCP Politburo Standing Committee member, or PSCM, secretary-general of the CCP High Level People&amp;#x27;s Congress, general secretary of the 12th Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing representative to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and member of the Politburo of China.</p>
<p>He is currently serving as a member of the 18th Politburo Standing Bureau of the Communist Party of China.</p>
<p>According to a report of the State Council Information Office (SCIO), Zheng De, the representative of China to the 16th Duma of the Russian Federation to discuss the Middle East peace process, and Yang Jiechi, the representative of China to the 17th Duma of the Russian Federation to discuss the North Korea-South Korea conflict at a meeting in the city of Vladivostok, were among the selected persons to meet with Xi Jinping at the Wuhan summit about global governance, the SCIO reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Beijing-based SCIO said that Li Changbai, the representative of the United States to the 17th Duma of the Russian Federation, and Li Heping, the representative of China to the 16th Duma of the Russian Federation, respectively, confirmed the participation of Chinese officials at the Wuhan summit.</p>
<p>Li Changbai said the country&amp;#x27;s perspective on Russia&amp;#x27;s position, which includes &amp;quot;a role of responsibility&amp;quot; in the settlement of the Korean Peninsula, the SCIO said. In the meeting, Li Changbai said the main point of discussion was &amp;quot;overlaps&amp;quot; in the 17th Duma of the Russian Federation and the 18th Duma of the Russian Federation, the SCIO said.</p>
<p>Li Heping said the discussion on North Korea-South Korea relations was very significant and &amp;quot;strongly emphasized that both sides should work together to solve the issues.&amp;quot;</p>
