<h1>Battalion Chief Mcgovern</h1>
<p>
Battalion Chief<br>
History<br>
Started in 1993 as part of Operation: ‘Restor’.<br>
Used four vehicles out of which 3 were Armoured.<br>
Needed a new head due to multiple repairs.<br>
Named ‘Battalion Chief’ due to his higher ranking as Chief Chief.<br>
Supervised the creation of ‘Operation: Restore’ which was in conjunction with Battalion Company.<br>
</p>
<p>Constructed the support unit houses, tanks, bunkers and other fortifications with the intention of being included in Operation: ‘Restore’ when the time was at hand.</p>
<p>His overall responsibilities included getting the bulk of construction ready for the time at hand.</p>
<h2>Director-General</h2>
<p>In June 2011, King Abdullah died and his father Saud was appointed Chairman of the King&amp;#x27;s Consort on the 8th of June 2011. At the beginning of the month, Dr. Abdullah was appointed as the Director General of Saudi Military and Security. Under his supervision, the agency started to reorganize. In the first place, the agency started to reorganize its fighting units and form teams and battalions, now known as ‘Advisors’. Also, the operation’s arms were restructured, which enabled more capabilities and preparedness of the Agency. This led to the conclusion on the need for a new head to replace those who were relieved recently. Although his rank, he graduated with a Master Degree in Civil engineering from the University of Ibadan.</p>
<p>January 2012 marked his official retirement from service.</p>
<h2>Who He Is and His Personality</h2>
<p>He was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 1980. He later emigrated with his parents to the United Kingdom. His family has remained in the kingdom for the past 22 years. He was married and had two children.</p>
<p>Abdullah was quiet and reserved. He knew only basic Arabic and not much of English. His sense of humour was also low. But it was later used as an asset in the military.</p>
<p>He was very well travelled, having lived and worked in Russia, France, Belgium, Mexico and England. His interests were not exclusively military. He loved cricket and made many friends in this sport.</p>
