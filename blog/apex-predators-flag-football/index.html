<h1>Apex Predators Flag Football</h1>
<p>The Apex Predators Football team is part of the Calgary Stampeders Football Club. The team is based in Calgary, Alberta, with practice and games held at TD Place Stadium.</p>
<p>The team has featured on the NHL live feeds for the last several years.</p>
<p>The team began in November 2001 and competed in the British Columbia Major C by playing in the British Columbia Premier Leagues Premier C tournament. The team has won the B.C Premier C Champions Hockey League Championship two other times that included winning in 2013, and winning the British Columbia Premier Leagues Premier B Championship in 2013 and 2015.</p>
<h2>Owl Storms Football Club</h2>
<p>Owl Storms Football is based in Portland, Oregon, located in the state of Oregon. The team has a team of athletes named Owl Storms. This team plays each year in an autographed Football uniform only. The team has received a lot of publicity from the Portland press. (a good time was had by all) You can find a team of men dressed in suits in the Portland Arena. It is a fun team to watch and it will give every fan a great laugh! We feature people who like to travel the world, have fun and some who enjoy doing simple jobs. The group plays games in a football bag (they are still called dogs) and gets a large car in the parking lot. The players enjoy games that are unique and encourage hard work and study. I know everyone is interested to see where this sport travels.</p>
<h2>Apex Predator Football Club</h2>
<p>The Apex Predator Football Club was founded in 1988. The club operates out of the very beautiful Eagle Ranch Park in Morningside, Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>
The team is also a great fit for the environment. It is run by many volunteers.<br>
