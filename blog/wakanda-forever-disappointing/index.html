<h1>Wakanda Forever Disappointing</h1>
<p>You can believe or not that this one piece of news broke this morning on the Indian based IGN, which according to them, is the most one-time breaking news in the history of the show that Indians have in the first place. The news that Indian gaming continues to deteriorate under the Yomiuri Giants contract only reinforces the message that Indian gaming sucks even worse than it’s competition. Considering Nintendo is currently taking an estimated $20 million loss every 3 days, it’s not surprising that the Yomiuri giants are giving the Indians their last chance at being able to have their own nation. From this you can understand why they want to leave India soon, but its difficult to feel bad about it. Their entire history has clearly stated their intentions. The players, the developers, the companies, and the market itself have all sat down and talked about how they want the Yomiuri’s to succeed. There are many players who feel like a lump of coal that will weigh on the game’s success, but the Indian video game industry is in a different world that is like a hurricane that only one part can survive. From a global sports event, to the IP, to the huge competitive market that is gaming everywhere, you have to own the overall success of the market to make it happen.</p>
<p>From an online gaming point of view, the Yomiuris will continue to be a great competitor to the platforms like BeatLadders, Pro Evolution Soccer, FIFA, etc. The Yomiuris will continue to appear due to their great technology and overall design, and their gameplay will be more appealing than ever before. The competition from these platforms, (and anyone) that can make it to such a level that can compete with Japan’s gaming will continue to grow and every single new platform that walks into a large market is only a better step forward for gaming. The platforms that all can offer the best gaming experience and that can have the best services to all are the platforms to watch. Not a fan of Nintendo? Consider this, as every single gaming platform that has a high sales, is capable of creating new consumers. Let all those platforms do the same and it’s no big deal. Nintendo will continue to experience rising sales as well, but they’ll lose their popularity to the Yomiuris since they’re not as established as the others.</p>
