<h1>49 Kendall Rd Lisbon Ct</h1>
<p>Open: 24 hours, during festivals from the end of July to the middle of August</p>
<p>* This is a temporary cover, use it only if you don´t have a hole in your car. No cover for parking and at night the street can be dangerous, so take precaution. Be aware that the place can be a fun and lively place with lots of popular nightclubs, gigs and parties during festivals.</p>
<h2>* Map:</h2>
<p>IMPORTANT: Parking has to be done at 30 meters from the venue. The number of stalls available at each venue is strictly controlled by a complex system. The event is covered by the liability insurance. However, you have to fill an application for an insurance and you will have to submit to a verification check. You have to pay a commission of 70% on every stall that is at the event.</p>
<h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
<p>If you cancel your reservation 100% of the booking price will be reimbursed.</p>
<p>PACKAGES can be taken over the phone 30-minutes after the table count. In case you send a message to the location and it does not arrive in the time as set by us, you cancel the booking.</p>
<p>Because of the erratic weather we are canceling the event outside of the pre-set times on many of the venues where we are arranging the event, so don&amp;#x27;t worry if you forgot your car, nobody has to get trapped in this huge risk and the impact on the image of the festival itself.</p>
<p>We will provide you as compensation a number of stickers, if you need it because the event takes place outside of the official area.</p>
<p>If you come to the reception location before 12pm and you find a bad situation, we give you 7 days to make everything right and we will reimburse 50% of the actual price.</p>
<p>We will do our best to give you our feedback and your feedback on some of the specific details of the booking so that the event, the management and the exhibitors can be more confident on what took place, in order to solve the issue.</p>
<p>Mentai Project, an independent international nonguide provider is offering an innovative free pass program that provides a great opportunity for participants to enjoy an incredible line up of talents from a wide range of fields (music, art, fashion, storytelling).</p>
