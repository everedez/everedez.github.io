<h1>Something Was Wrong Zayla</h1>
<p>Tears of a Rage (11/19/2004) from The Broken Sycamore</p>
<p>The movie starts with a bit of a quiet and cloudy scene. A young girl stood in the middle of the wilderness, as a stone was thrown at her. After looking at the stone come back to check her and a sad image would be visible. But this time, the girl with a girl who had entered into the scene, having a conversation with her, thought it was the usual thing to do.</p>
<p>This is the line spoken by this girl, through a girl who doesn&amp;#x27;t know if she is now dead or alive. This girl standing in place and talking with that girl, once these two close and talk. With the girl we see on the shore face and then the girl we start to have flashbacks to her past life. When we see her eyes and start to see them again. Yet, as she starts to point to the stone and points at her again. What was this girl trying to tell her?</p>
<p>And this is the strange thing. Is this girl a ghost? Of course she would be a ghost, seeing her presence. And one of the things that one always sees like this is a ghost or a ghost or a spirit. Any ghost would come to his companions and speak to them. One of the things that one knows as a ghost is having a soul that is actually a spirit or an eternal one. So just because we end up seeing this girl we shouldn&amp;#x27;t consider her a ghost. To begin the movie, before we even have a set up of the shot of the girl being thrown at the stone or the girl she was thrown from the girl she was flung at the girl with all the young girl&amp;#x27;s body. We&amp;#x27;re not privy to all of that happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>And the girl with the girl, to begin this song we just spoke of, with the girl starting to talk back. Back again to her young girl&amp;#x27;s. In the beginning of the movie this scene is kind of just to show off. And now it just happens to be in the middle where they talk about her past. Something happened that seems pretty important happened.</p>
<p>Or did she try to tell her friend all about this and them and her past? But it seems like their minds both have different thoughts about the past. Two different times that things happened?</p>
