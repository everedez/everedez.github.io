<h1>Cang Ji Occupation Dislyte</h1>
<p>For those using, and for those who wish to resist, a sense of humor is essential.</p>
<h2>- The Sun Daily (Nanjing, Jiangxi)</h2>
<p>The Cang Ji, or &amp;quot;Opposing Cotton Youth&amp;quot;, was a major cause of the Boxer Rebellion and also played a role in the Peasants&amp;#x27; uprising. In China&amp;#x27;s first provincial-level rebellion, which occurred throughout China in 1877, the Cang Jiens (literally, &amp;quot;Proud Cows&amp;quot;; jie means &amp;quot;proud&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;mastered one&amp;#x27;s right, acquired one&amp;#x27;s first quality&amp;quot;) defeated a large number of imperial guards at a food station on the Yangtze River and began to ravage and plunder the area.</p>
<p>The Cang Jiens appeared as the armies in many of the early rebellion accounts were found in southern China&amp;#x27;s Zhoushan region, under the command of Yan Xishu, who had previously fought the Eunuch Yang Ling. Although Yan did not have the strength to participate in major battles, his troops did cause significant damage as they approached Guanjingan (Cang Jin; literally, &amp;quot;Reinforcements Cattle&amp;quot;). The Cang Jiens eventually moved south into Hunan.</p>
<p>The Boxer Rebellion was an uprising on behalf of the government of the Qing dynasty, waged in China during the mid-1860s, during the period of the decadent Qing dynasty and the subsequent collapse of central authority in that area. The Boxers (Chin Kuo) represented the aspirations and religious fervor of many Eastern Europe peasantry who wished to be subjects of the Qing dynasty. It has been estimated that in total 7 out of 10 human voices recorded saying &amp;quot;Chin Kuo&amp;quot; during the rebellion can be traced back to the Eastern European peasantry.</p>
<p>In the 1920s, when the Boxers took over Beijing, a portion of Boxer China remained, mostly in the ancient Shun dynasty (the other half in Liang Dynasty (second century AD). This region still contains many Ming ethnicity because it was an administrative frontier with Liang Xia (Liu Zhen) ruled before the Northern-Siang (Mongolia) mission [of the Western Han dynasty] reached their region and became Chinese territory in the third decade of the Third Han dynasty (206 AD-259 AD) by putting in political exile the previous Liang Xia ruler&amp;#x27;s extended family.</p>
