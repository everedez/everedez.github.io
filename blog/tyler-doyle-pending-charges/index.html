<h1>Tyler Doyle Pending Charges</h1>
<p>
Ammon&amp;#x27;s is the accused party.<br>
Not only did Kevin Ames have a shotgun at his residence,<br>
but we now have evidence to support that very fact.<br>
</p>
<p>(As of this writing, Kevin&amp;#x27;s home is in Des Moines. It is believed that Kevin could possibly leave his residence, but that Kevin is likely to return. Also, Kevin has paid for his and his family&amp;#x27;s funerals, which is why the name of the store that ran the funeral arrangements is not being written in here, but we want it out of a spirit of fairness and transparency).</p>
<p>It is believed that Kevin killed himself on Jan 23rd, 2013.</p>
<p>The charges for his acts upon killing himself are: 2 counts of first-degree criminal sodomy, 2 counts of second-degree criminal sodomy, 2 counts of third-degree sexual assault, and 1 count of first-degree criminal sexual assault.</p>
<p>The second-degree sexual assault counts involve the following acts:</p>
<p>Mr. Kevin Ames was a sexual harasser. And he was able to perpetrate and be in a position of sexual dominance toward numerous sexual partners. The man repeatedly exposed himself for the express purpose of forcing the women to perform sexual acts on him. And on a couple of occasions, at the women&amp;#x27;s discretion, Mr. Ames made his sexual advances toward the women in the men&amp;#x27;s restroom. The women chose to continue being the sexual objects of his sexual advances, in order to maintain their power over him and maintain their dominance at any later cost.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kevin&amp;#x27;s criminal sexual assault charges are not being pursued because he could not protect the women who were more vulnerable than himself.</p>
<p>There were two women in the room by the time Mr. Kevin Ames got to his room. The women were not under control. They were very susceptible to Kevin&amp;#x27;s sexual advances. For example, the 2 ladies identified by the prosecutor as &amp;quot;the 2 women who were particularly vulnerable.&amp;quot; According to the prosecutor, at the very least, those 2 women were put in a position of rape.</p>
