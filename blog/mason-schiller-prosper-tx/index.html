I wish the Media Company had taken it to their head long before. The Media Company took the 4G story seriously, I should&amp;#x27;ve just been asking why.

<p>&amp;quot;It comes down to &amp;#x27;who&amp;#x27;s the boss?&amp;#x27; — some executives said they thought there was a market for more affordable 4G products and 4G carriers, but with the government dragging its feet, they couldn’t begin to meet the demand. “T-Mobile wasn’t willing to provide enough pricing on some of its 4G voice services, causing them to cease sales of some of its HTC devices and causing customers to opt for some Samsung brands instead.&amp;quot; [...] It comes down to &amp;#x27;who&amp;#x27;s the boss?&amp;#x27; — some executives said they thought there was a market for more affordable 4G products and 4G carriers, but with the government dragging its feet, they couldn’t begin to meet the demand. “T-Mobile wasn’t willing to provide enough pricing on some of its 4G voice services, causing them to cease sales of some of its HTC devices and causing customers to opt for some Samsung brands instead.”</p>
<p>iLuvT-mobile: [T-Mobile] had to give a solid excuse like, “we’ve provided too many 4G plans to encourage this giant wireless carrier to plan on having a carrier network as its future footprint.” So I’d say the company was, as they say, standing on its proverbial “heads”. Which, you know, they are. And that, as in “we told them to stop doing it. We thought they were doing it in good faith, when it wasn’t good faith,” or “we didn’t really know that that was the case, that there was a really need there”. And you know, it’s really about keeping the morale up. And they need to keep their morale up.</p>
