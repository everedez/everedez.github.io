<h1>Imap Ussay</h1>
<p>There will be huge problems with the current situation in Russia, and those problems will explode in the direction of the US. For this reason I will spell out some potential routes to go in the best possible scenario…and the US will find a way to counter these, too.</p>
<p>First, US aims to become an superpower as a matter of its own will. Such an era does not require dramatic improvements on the national political system and so the US will ignore such opportunities of US’ dominance if they arise. However we do not know the extent to which this could happen so the US could end up bringing this about eventually.</p>
<p>A second fact that the US aims for in such a period is that any country that suffers a long period of economic decline (i.e. in the Russia) will call for US to help it. The US does not want a common enemy but a common friend.</p>
<p>In the future, with better-or-worse economic situation, there will come a specific moment when the US will have to help. It will not be the Russian threat alone. If we look more carefully at other areas of Russia in which US may want to use them to expand its influence, we find that they include Central Asia and Northeast Europe, where US interests will be concentrated and very specific.</p>
<p>Therefore, let’s take the first attempt in this direction, the Russian intervention in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The plan for this has been proposed by the US official defense department under Secretary Mattis and two Defense Secretaries, William Cohen and Robert Gates. They imagine ‘partnering’ a local government that is (obviously) willing to cooperate in Ukraine and setting up a joint US/European army. The Russian defense minister agreed to this a few days ago, under that condition: That the Europeans recognize the right of the US to intervene in Ukraine. This is, among other things, an indication that US is simply not satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Further, an important component of the plan is the participation of the US Navy in Ukraine. The US Navy will certainly not act only with the support of NATO. Washington wants to use warships as well. The US Navy has already deployed some aircraft and small units to Ukraine to support the Ukrainian armed forces. This force consists of six aircraft carrier-ver#################### and three massive long-range landing boats.</p>
