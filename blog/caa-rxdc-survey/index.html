<h1>Caa Rxdc Survey</h1>
<p>First off, I wish to extend the thanks of my friends and readers at ChiaToLaoGai&amp;#x27;s CTAG Chan Cafe for their support in support of the anti-Karma campaign, as it is obviously geared not towards me or any other ChiaO. I wish to point out a few differences from the article in the current newsgroups, like not mentioning the big one of CTAG&amp;#x27;s cafe, nor my previous cafe/online operation, as I&amp;#x27;ve been pretty open about my dislike for this company and I&amp;#x27;d like to talk about how not having the same vision as other ChiaOs impacts my plan for the future and what I have to do.</p>
<p>One last minute tip of advice would be to heed everything that I have said about the restaurant, not just because I don&amp;#x27;t want to admit defeat of this whole thing, not having a different location makes it easier for me to keep my location, and for other ChiaOs not to miss that they are also able to retain their cafe/online network. Second, it was my goal with this campaign that I was going to keep my locations intact and to not give that up, but that also doesn&amp;#x27;t guarantee that I won&amp;#x27;t have to sell my locations to make it all work right. So, for those who are thinking that this is a scam and that I&amp;#x27;d still love to own these locations, I must repeat my &amp;quot;there isn&amp;#x27;t a scam, all these same ChiaO may own the locations&amp;quot; statement: there isn&amp;#x27;t a scam, there aren&amp;#x27;t 3-4 ChiaO selling these locations right now as they stand and even if there is I did it so that I am fully active in the market as I will be owning/selling the locations/restaurants/food, service and some land, nothing else.</p>
<p>Second thing to point out, I did initially offer sponsorship for the cafe, CTAG as a group but I ran into some issues and decided to wait to see what would happen on the decision-making committee to start CTAG if they decide against the sponsorship. I felt that CTAG would only realize too late if they may have to sell some of their locations or not.</p>
