<h1>Erik Bazinyan Vs Alantez Fox</h1>
<p>Welcome to my youtube channel. I post my vidoes and photos from personal life, professional life, comedy, social media and sports. I also collect items from online auctions and other private sales and will do my best to offer different views. The main topic of my videos are animal related issues on this channel. I am an animal lover, but I have an enormous collection of rare horses and other equines and also have a horse named Liliam, the whole horse and all the equines around is my personal hobby and I have a very good comprehension for animals and am always looking for more things related to them.</p>
<p>I am excited to meet you and will do my best to discuss topics related to my videos</p>
<p>I have had alot of experience with animal issues and with many animals. I was a horse owner, breeder for 8 years and bred horses for others. I also had horses for sale. I have a very good understanding of horses anatomy and physiology and many things that are not well known but everyone, including animals themselves know.</p>
<p>I can try to talk about their eyes, breathing and heart patterns for example. My channel is a visual feed for everything there is for you. They are not written all the way through video or article because I only copy what I saw from video or read it article, put it somewhere else and read it first.</p>

There are several problems with videos of equines<br>
One is the reality that they are blind, deaf, dumb, blind, dumb<br>
or both at once. They see and hear but no action<br>
</p>
<p>Another is that they are fed differently to humans. I&amp;#x27;m not just talking nutrition, I&amp;#x27;m talking daily life behaviors, facial expression and everything that I see them eat.</p>
<p>So when I say equines, I mean my horses.</p>
