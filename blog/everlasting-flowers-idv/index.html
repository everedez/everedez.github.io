<h1>Everlasting Flowers Idv</h1>
<h3>Fluid Thoughts</h3>
<p>Have you all noticed how you&amp;#x27;re starting to see the color in your home. Let me explain something; most people see just blue. First they were blue, then they were yellow, then they were green, then purple. And now you&amp;#x27;re starting to see pink!</p>
<p>I saw pink colors everywhere! I was convinced they came from blood. I&amp;#x27;m sensing that the color is water infused.</p>
<p>Just like the colors we see in the sky as we head out on outings, the pink we&amp;#x27;re seeing coming from all around us would be the same water as shown in The Blue Hour</p>
<p>
That Water of Colour<br>
For the past few months now I&amp;#x27;ve been to a new part of the United States called the<br>
Blue Hour. It&amp;#x27;s an event where women get together, get together, and paint pink.<br>
Here&amp;#x27;s how the event is usually described; “Women paint together and paint for the blue hour“.<br>
</p>
<p>I got myself the opportunity to paint a pink painting for a women of color called Essence Art and the painting was almost finished last night. You can even get a pink copy which can be a $49.95 value!</p>
<p>As I was waiting for my favorite red and blue pen, I remembered for this painting and if I could paint with any paint, red and blue pens would be perfect! I looked up Essence, the event and decided to give it a try.</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>1. Essence Art stands for &amp;quot;Essence Art Nonprofit Organization Inc.&amp;quot;<br>
2. “The Yellow Wall” is a group of sisters who paint the most and get named &amp;quot;The Yellow Wall&amp;quot; because of the colors they choose. Now I&amp;#x27;m a Yellow Wall, by the way.<br>
3. The blue hour has been a long-running event where women paint together in support of women, girls, and people of color since 1997 and the first 2015 event I went to was called “The Blue Hour“.<br>
4. The event is starting to gain more attention with a collection of pink pink pink pink pink paintings being sold for a number of years. I guess that&amp;#x27;s part of the paint history when it comes to color.<br>
