<h1>Dr Ainsley Pratt</h1>
<p>PATTENS, VA, Aug. 22, 2006 ( homers.com ) -- &amp;quot;The Walking Dead&amp;quot; had an edge on the new &amp;quot;Unstoppable&amp;quot; series when it came to gore and violence. &amp;quot;Unstoppable&amp;quot; has been out for two seasons and comes out on September 5, 2006.</p>
<p>Shyam Dhawan has added a pinch of comedic flare to the series. His first acting in the series, &amp;quot;Mirror Mirror&amp;quot; (Nov. 2004), saw him trying to kill everyone out of fear; there is a chance that viewers will get a look at the series&amp;#x27; latest twist.</p>
<p>Dhawan, who won an Emmy for best supporting actor for &amp;quot;Saved by the Bell,&amp;quot; recently released a comedy album in March entitled &amp;quot;My Brother&amp;#x27;s Callin&amp;#x27; Me A Script.&amp;quot; On it, he sings, &amp;quot;Oh why it&amp;#x27;s so hard to die/ I can&amp;#x27;t go out like this/ I can&amp;#x27;t even count the minutes/ I can&amp;#x27;t, I can&amp;#x27;t go out like this.&amp;quot; He also said, &amp;quot;I was excited after the last show to read the script, that they were going to kill everyone in the world. I was nervous at first, &amp;#x27;Am I insane?&amp;#x27;&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Fans of the series know the &amp;quot;death row&amp;quot; aspect very well as this was the original premise of the show. People are housed in prisons. After the prison&amp;#x27;s cells become uninhabitable, people must attempt to sneak back to the prison and warn others, who may have already been killed, of the impending doom that awaits them there.</p>
<p>In this light-hearted episode &amp;quot;Reaper of the Year&amp;quot; (season 4, episode 1), things get darker for the contestants: Dawn (Tawny Newsom), the innocent baby killer, has been living on death row for five full seasons and is now an elderly widower who wants to be free. The prison has been running body doubles - people who impersonate the actual dead characters to bring Dawn closer to the end.</p>
<p>Both actors playing Dawn and Tommy Rettig play some version of both criminals and victims. Rettig, who made his role into a series regular in the season 5 finale, &amp;quot;Deadwood,&amp;quot; won a Daytime Emmy Award for best supporting actor in a comedy series performance.</p>
