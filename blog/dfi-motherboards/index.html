<h1>Dfi Motherboards</h1>
<p>Since buying the Atmel AVR Extreme, I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Atmel X-Gene micro-controllers. If there is one board to be avoided, it would have to be the AVR Extreme. When buying, one is expected to test the X1 on various motherboard, since they need to be fully compatible. I did exactly that, and to my surprise there are no other boards to test the X-Gene on, and none that work using the X-Gene! In fact, the X-Gene is not that popular among Micro-ATX boards, so it was no surprise that there were none available for purchase in the US, Canada or Germany except for the Canadian Asus Rampage II Board. Today I am publishing the list of the X-Gene boards that are available and what they do.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that there are some boards that are available, most of them will work only on Gigabyte boards, (i.e. Gigabyte GA-H73LT-VM and Gigabyte GA-H73DV-VM SATA), so it would not make sense to try and buy those boards. I did test the different versions of Gigabyte boards, and the ones I recommend would be the same ones that are listed here.</p>
<p>Note: some people prefer the Gigabyte GA-H73M3-VM for the Gigabyte GA-H73DV-VM. However, the Gigabyte GA-H73M3-VM itself does not even have a USB port, so I recommended the Gigabyte GA-H73DV-VM for those people because the Gigabyte GA-H73M3-VM has an internal USB slot which you need for connecting it to some of the boards that do not have it.</p>
<p>General use-cases</p>
<p>-SLI video outputs-USB-to-UART interface to play AVCHD video on x.org and MythTV-Dual GPU acceleration-WLAN interface that can be used for tablets-Uses some internal memory, some programmable buttons, but it is restricted with only 256KB of RAM!</p>
