Obituary: FRISCO MEADOWS MORSE, 92, SANTA ANA, INTERIM<br>
April 24, 1991<br>

DONOVAN VALLEY, California, April 24, 1991—San Francisco’s Frisco Memo! — and his loving family wish to thank the<br>
San Antonio Express-News and Texas Tribune for their efforts to bring Mr. Morse’s story to light.<br>
In her memory,Frisco&amp;#x27;s late son-in-law, Steve Hambrick, says, &amp;quot;Mrs. Morse was the kindest, sweetest<br>
woman that I&amp;#x27;ve ever known. She was a wonderful mother, and we deeply loved her. Not because of her caring,<br>
but because of her knowledge and her honesty. I think it is my honor that all her memories were shared.<br>
Don&amp;#x27;t miss this good-naturedly-delighted and passionate young woman.&amp;quot;<br>
On the occasion of his 90th birthday, he also wished to thank those who influenced his life, such as his daughter<br>
Mary, who has made it her mission to build<br>
up his loving memory and inspire others to do the same. &amp;quot;What happened to me and my family is really no<br>
different from any other family struggling to make it through a difficult time. Our hearts go out to everyone<br>
who has suffered hardship. We think of ourselves as saints even though we have seen the glory of martyrdom ourselves.<br>
Like everyone else, you can count on the Lord for every blessing during difficult times. I am so grateful<br>
you have known God and have experienced His mercy through us. May the grace of God always overflow to you.&amp;quot;<br>
In loving tribute, Frisco&amp;#x27;s beloved son-in-law, Steve, added, &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s a challenge for me<br>
to think of you as being in my funeral casket at sea, as I look down the big steel tub from the International<br>
Completion Bridge, but I know that you would never let me down and guide me home. You are the type of person I want<br>
to say goodbye to. You taught me how to be a grandfather, an uncle, a brother and a man.<br>
