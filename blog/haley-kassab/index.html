“I urge you as parents, and the people you care about, to not stop and choose a career you want,” he said..<br>
</p>
<p>“We are asking our young women to do this job. And we should be asking every young man in this country — who isn’t thinking about getting a degree in engineering — to get his degree in engineering.”</p>
<p>“You should do all the leg work that would allow women in the STEM fields to be in these positions,” she said.</p>
<p>“Education is key” and the benefits of education are &amp;quot;the highest and the best form education can bring to a young person.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>— Katie Thomas, President of the National Assembly for Women, the umbrella organization of the women-led coalition.</p>
<p>“The system that they have built in this country has worked for the last 60 years and I think one of the big reasons is the fact that we have such an educated workforce,” she said.</p>
<p>That workforce has allowed families to make an educated choice about where to send their children.</p>
<p>“The problem is our system is more about that, than actually getting educated. This is a system that is set up not for those women who want to go after STEM, but for those who use the workforce to have access to power,” she said, to laughs from the audience.</p>
<p>“The system for a wage guarantee, two years after every student leaves school, this system is broken, and it won’t work,” said Thomas.</p>
<p>
“Culminating in the issue of parental leave in England,” she said.<br>
“Everyone is entitled to maternity and paternity leave. This is not a story on the tax implications on this,” she said.<br>
“I’m not asking you all to get married during your lifetime. I’m not asking you to marry when you’re about 44.<br>
