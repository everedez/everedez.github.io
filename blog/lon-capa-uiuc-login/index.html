Ranked play<br>
</p>
<p>League of Legends has long been famous for its competitive and depth structure in both teams and players. League of Legends has a distinct system of &amp;quot;Rankings&amp;quot; allowing both individuals and teams to rank players as well as players for their respective roles, and has many different ranked play modes for two-, three-, or four-round/competitive matches. However, League of Legends has not had a public ranking system for over 10 years, and it is now in its 8th year of existence and popularity as a competitive game.</p>
<p>With our new ranked mode system we hope to accomplish one of two goals:</p>
<p>Solve ranking issues for a much broader audience</p>
<p>Update player rankings to the point where League players actually &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; in rankings</p>
<p>Solve ranking issues for a much broader audience: During ranked play, each player&amp;#x27;s ranking provides a consistent rank for which type of player they belong. This is a huge step in rebuilding League of Legends&amp;#x27;s reputation.</p>
