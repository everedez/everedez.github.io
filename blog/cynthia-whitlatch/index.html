Thanks for that correction, I like you keep getting people believing in me! It&amp;#x27;s quite hilarious and it was amusing to find out that you have an actual e-mail address, and for some reason I didn&amp;#x27;t click it. ;-) Seriously, you should give it a shot!
After Christmas, I actually had two weeks off. The first one was a family trip to Iowa where my kids had a blast, and all was right with the world.">

<p>Thanks for that correction, I like you keep getting people believing in me! It&amp;#x27;s quite hilarious and it was amusing to find out that you have an actual e-mail address, and for some reason I didn&amp;#x27;t click it. ;-) Seriously, you should give it a shot!</p>
<p>After Christmas, I actually had two weeks off. The first one was a family trip to Iowa where my kids had a blast, and all was right with the world. Oh, except for the stomach bug. Fortunately a friend who had just had his tonsils out saved me from taking a long series of antibiotics. Thanks, good friend! I went on to spend the rest of the holidays with various family members.</p>
<p>I came home on what seemed an ordinary day, had a job interview, went to work on Monday, and two days straight of work followed. Fortunately, none of that set back the process. I was in the sales department, working until 10pm, when I was allowed to take off from the office. (It was in the middle of the afternoon, right on top of Christmas time) I made sure I took my suitcase with me, and headed down the street to a very nice boutique downtown. I was in the stock room selecting stock for the next day&amp;#x27;s sales. I just realized I didn&amp;#x27;t have a ticket for the plane ride on Friday. My ticket had expired and was no longer valid. I&amp;#x27;m sorry, sorry, sorry, I can&amp;#x27;t make it tonight, so I would really like a refund or a new ticket. Could you look into my ticket? How embarrassing. I made out as a new customer, and the clerk came over looking for my ID.</p>
<p>On the flight home, my mind was in a whirl. I had the entire family with me, but my wife and daughter were stuck in the front row of the plane with each and every one of us. I had just asked for your kind word at the office and the airline representative had given me the same exact reply as the other times she had seen me, &amp;quot;we have nothing to tell you, your husband isn&amp;#x27;t going to be flying.&amp;quot; I knew then and there that something was wrong with my car, but I wasn&amp;#x27;t able to fathom when it would happen.</p>
