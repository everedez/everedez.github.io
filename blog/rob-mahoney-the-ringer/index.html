<h1>Rob Mahoney The Ringer</h1>
<h3>Three Points to Consider This Season</h3>
<p>Posted on Aug 19, 2013, 7:51 PM by Ringer owner and original Pittsburgh head coach Dick Butkus</p>
<p>The Steelers are a very sound football team. Teams aren’t known for consistency because they try hard and think and adapt. Well, the Steelers are very sound the way it looks right now. Some of the guys, a more in depth look at the team with its up and down years.</p>
<p>There are no new faces on the Steelers. The Steelers have been here a long, long time. There is no changing the plan, no flocking to the new and improved Seattle and playing one that doesn’t end up with the end result you want. All players face the music when they come off the field at OTAs and minicamps and their own comfort level in the locker room will be the factor in what they do. The Steelers on the field is where players show their best with hard contact, a little offense, and play fast the way the coordinator wants. In those words, there is no way to say this team won’t perform well. There is work to be done. What is there to show for it the past 3 seasons? Well, there are tons.</p>
<p>Linebackers Matt Wells and Bud Dupree may be joined later in the draft by future Hall of Famers Alan Williams and Dion Lewis. There may be an AFC Championship or three or 4. There may be future NFL starter Desai Jones. There are prospects from Super Bowl champion defenses like Ray Edwards, Justin Stuckey, and James Harrison. There is the possibility of an injury. There is the possibility of injury and illness. There are some great chances for some pretty good players.</p>
<p>There are young guys that work extremely hard doing what they do. There are players that seem to progress year after year. There were players that were young and lost in the draft. There are players that some may have the chance (both on and off the field) of being starters for the Steelers. There are fans that have heard a lot about this team and want the team to start playing for the fans and soon. There are the scouts on the team that make that transition happen. They come up with how things really are on the field.</p>
