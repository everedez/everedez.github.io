<p>Hiyanna Onayoshi. I picked up this trainee by coincidence, as I was looking for such an entry! I spotted him at a train station in Inuyama, Toyama Prefecture on a Saturday morning while I was searching for places to eat. I noticed that it was between two stations which were close together, so I thought it might be convenient for the trainee to go and have a meal there, since I didn&amp;#x27;t know where I could get lunch after my long day of searching for Wnt Railway parts.</p>
<p>My first impression was just that this guy looked too cool. He looked more or less like some sort of a cartoon, the kind that you see in a manga. And his tattoos bore the names of Wnt Railway locations -- Ichabu, Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Kashiwa. I decided that it would be nice to meet this person at work and show him my kajitsu (tea ceremony) uniform. After talking for a while, we said goodbye and parted ways.</p>
<p>Hiyoka. Now, I immediately thought that this guy looked cool, so I asked him a few questions:</p>
<p>Am I an apprentice trainee? Have I been assigned to a job? Do I need to have my trainee number on my arm? What are my training job requirements? How many hours do I have to train?</p>
<p>Hiyoka is not exactly a native speaker. He couldn&amp;#x27;t speak Japanese well before meeting me and so I got him to write down what I asked.</p>
<p>First of all, he said that he was assigned to work on his training, not receive any special training like one&amp;#x27;s training job is. (Inuyama Station is near and so you know that the shops there are full of Wnt Railway goods.)</p>
<p>He said he was assigned to work on various parts, not only trainee-trainee parts. For example, he thought for some parts, you needed to do a little work before you had to make a good start on the work.</p>
