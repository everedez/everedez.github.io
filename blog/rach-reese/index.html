I think it&amp;#x27;s time to have a drink. C&amp;#x27;mon, who likes?<br>
The booze is supposed to be in my head, man. For real.<br>
Me. Let&amp;#x27;s play<br>

<p>...well not there since I just poohed out my a$$ and threw up in some random place outside of town, this I know only you know...</p>
<p>That other shitty job you tried from ten years ago that didn&amp;#x27;t make it for you is still stuck to you in some stank pissy jail (I know, I haven&amp;#x27;t cried once since it started happening). And you just can&amp;#x27;t understand this yet you&amp;#x27;re too used to lying, betraying and hurting people to act right.</p>
<p>Shit man, what do you want to drink</p>
<p>Tea, black, cheap tea, that&amp;#x27;s right, I mean you. You just want a drink, right? No other reason than that. You just don&amp;#x27;t want a job at all. Your mother&amp;#x27;s getting mad at you for just sitting around drinking tea while you get wasted and watching your ass.</p>
<p>Jerk, huh. You pissed someone off, and that&amp;#x27;s just common courtesy. What are you, some kind of asshole!</p>
<p>See I told you that your mother thought you were some kind of asshole, and she&amp;#x27;s right. You want to piss someone off you should get mad. You just can&amp;#x27;t go around doing shit like this. Get up, jerk...wake up.</p>
<p>
&amp;#x27;To a n<br>
Aya, to a n o<br>
(n, now I&amp;#x27;m gonna let you up, you&amp;#x27;re being a prick!)<br>
Fuck off, I mean it!<br>
Grace, but then he starts asking about you again, &amp;quot;What&amp;#x27;s up, my man?&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>You keep on talking as if you just woke up after a boring day, but you&amp;#x27;re still awake. That&amp;#x27;s why you didn&amp;#x27;t respond to me, so you can go talk to your boss to get him fired to this idiot you treated that way. And since it wasn&amp;#x27;t clear that I was even still there then my &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; didn&amp;#x27;t want to lose his job. So that&amp;#x27;s what you did.</p>
