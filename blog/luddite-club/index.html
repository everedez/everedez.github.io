<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Industrial Revolution of the early 19th Century had been the momentous revolution that has profoundly changed the landscape of industrial life. For this revolution not only introduced new steam power, steam-powered rail and automobile production but transformed transport, industry, and society even more.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution also coincided with the agricultural revolution resulting from the use of improved refrigerators, improved seeds, new methods of farming, improved irrigation, new livestock and more. It was this agricultural revolution that led to the rise of the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>Within five years of the Industrial Revolution beginning the next movement in human history occurred, and that was the Industrial Revolution - the movement of power and knowledge in the value system of the economy.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution soon transitioned to the information age in Western Europe and America.</p>
<p>The period that preceded and overtaken it brought great new inventions such as the telephone, television and other forms of mass communication.</p>
<p>In the following era of the Industrial Revolution, the new power led to the power of money, a shift brought from the production of goods and services to the production of money.</p>
<p>The resulting monetary power led to a desire across society and the revolution eventually leads to the emergence of the industrial economy.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution led to major social changes, to a marked growth of the individualistic, consumerist culture across the Americas, the European continent and the Middle East. This has led, in turn, to the development of the philosophy that drives modern capitalist society, namely the value system that values the production of material goods for consumption as opposed to the creation of new value. This philosophy was further promoted by the invention of new machines and new technologies that produce material goods at a lower cost than those produced by the previous methods of production.</p>
<p>All of this culminated with the invention of the Industrial Revolution, and the advent of the global economy in the 20th century. The economic system which emerged from the Industrial Revolution is one of the world&amp;#x27;s most powerful, the World Bank has noted, because it allows and even encourages the investment of a massive amount of human capital to economic growth.</p>
<p>The political shifts that occurred in the age of the Industrial Revolution would change political power and power relations, and would bring about a new ideology of power and economics.</p>
