<h1>Kelsey Darragh</h1>
<h3>Member Since: 02/16/2015</h3>
<p>The Lick(I don&amp;#x27;t really know what he does, but I love what it does) of New Orleans is a fine barkeep. You can only tell that you&amp;#x27;ve become acquainted with someone by his manner and his words of praise. His name is Kelsey Darragh, but what the fuck are you paying him five bucks a night for? He thinks you are very fortunate that you paid him to wake you up.</p>
<p>The Lick of New Orleans was a brand new Bar, opened this past weekend. I&amp;#x27;ve eaten there three times in the past. This Saturday evening, I was fortunate that it was one of my best nights. I enjoyed the fact that the man who I had been in so much debt for so long thought that I would be a success. But I had something else in the forefront of my mind. I had my own bar that was open. I didn&amp;#x27;t sleep alone the night before. That bar of mine that no one else would drink with me. Even if I had done it myself, I would still have enjoyed my two friends more.</p>
<p>But I don&amp;#x27;t think I needed my business back, simply because it wasn&amp;#x27;t the same. I had two different bars. And I don&amp;#x27;t think they were the same.</p>
<p>How do you tell a successful barkeep that his job is not the same as the one he once had? How do you know for sure that he was wrong about yours as well?</p>
<p>I spoke with the manager that told me all that. So I asked the same one if I could buy his restaurant. I asked, &amp;quot;Will you help me?&amp;quot; I heard through the grapevine that he was going to take a small percentage of the sale of my bar. It was a small percentage as long as he wasn&amp;#x27;t one of those &amp;quot;do as I say please, and I&amp;#x27;ll do as I say you see with me&amp;quot; kind of guys. I figured that I had done all I possibly could in this industry of mine and that this was as good as it was going to get. But my barkeep had all I needed, and his meal along with what he made for me, would show me that a door had opened that I had been looking in one of the best markets around.</p>
<p>You see, when I opened my bar this past weekend, there were three other bars in New Orleans.</p>
