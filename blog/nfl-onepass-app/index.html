The NFL season is winding down and so are the free agents being scooped up by the players and the teams. However, there is one group that is consistently racking up free agents, but undercutting the status quo. This group is consisting of NFL players that are getting their own NFL app to help them maintain their own coaching staffs in their own neighborhoods. NFL App was started by two young NFL Players, Chris Buchanan and Dan Walker, who created the NFL for fans and told their stories of how they became football coaches.">

<p>The NFL season is winding down and so are the free agents being scooped up by the players and the teams. However, there is one group that is consistently racking up free agents, but undercutting the status quo. This group is consisting of NFL players that are getting their own NFL app to help them maintain their own coaching staffs in their own neighborhoods. NFL App was started by two young NFL Players, Chris Buchanan and Dan Walker, who created the NFL for fans and told their stories of how they became football coaches. The NFL App was created in 2016, and the NFL has been committed to staying in touch with the players, and improving the app. Since we first discovered that the players were taking this approach towards their coach searches, we decided to keep you up to date every Friday by sending you our notifications. The reason for this week&amp;#x27;s posts are mainly to show how difficult it is to search your coach yourself, because the NFL is so large, there are many options. Right now, we have coaches for all 32 NFL squads looking for coaches in their own neighborhoods. The only issue is trying to narrow it down to those that are close to you. One of the most frustrating parts of the app process is searching for coaches that are geographically based, meaning a bad day, at work, or even working somewhere that you won&amp;#x27;t live in. The best way to get better at this is by letting someone know your location, and asking them to share a google map coordinates or address of your house. The app also requires a key to be setup, on top of the phone, before you will be able to load everything you&amp;#x27;ll be searching for. This is usually done by making the phone call to the player that has the key setup, or they will need to set it themselves via texting or gmail. By simply setting the key up, you are instantly able to find coaches in many different parts of the world, without a ton of extra effort.</p>
