Many Libertarian Presidential Candidates are Anti-Regime because they believe America will soon witness regime change under the leadership of a democratic party that poses a serious threat to our republic. This is because they are attempting to deflect any real and long term threat to our nation from our own government into the hands of other government agents, like the regime of Israel, a regime that acts irrationally by manipulating the direction and intent of the American people.">

<p>Many Libertarian Presidential Candidates are Anti-Regime because they believe America will soon witness regime change under the leadership of a democratic party that poses a serious threat to our republic. This is because they are attempting to deflect any real and long term threat to our nation from our own government into the hands of other government agents, like the regime of Israel, a regime that acts irrationally by manipulating the direction and intent of the American people. Rather than facing the global evil that is run and operated by the United States of America, they instead accuse us of being the source of it. They tell us that the United States of America is the center of the world&amp;#x27;s effort to accomplish various governmental ends, while they insist that the United States of America is the only country fighting for these ends. The US is alleged to practice a vicious totalitarian “police state” mentality that operates without lawful warrants, without transparency, with secretive operations of espionage, surveillance, and force against all but its own citizens.</p>
<p>This is because they are being far removed from the actual reality of the evil that exists within their own government. It is also said by them that no one is even remotely to blame. They refuse to say who is the one who brought the evil that exists inside the United States of America into existence. These people, and they have many of them, are the architects of the Iraq War, as well as the CIA, the Mossad, the Pentagon, etc.</p>
<p>What is most often missed or ignored is that the fundamental evil that exists inside the United States of America is not in reality inside the government itself. The government itself has been utterly hijacked by the evil forces that also exist within it, but within another cause altogether.</p>
