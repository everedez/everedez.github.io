<h1>Devyn Keith And Melody</h1>
<p>December, 2016 - The Wounded Lion - I wrote it last winter. I’m heading over to the Kretz Hall in May to have a write up of it. I’ll be adding it here.</p>
<p>I’m fairly certain this was started by a man whose work I enjoy. I’ve read quite a bit of his fiction over the years. I’ve also included some links to my favorite of his pieces before, where I posted: https://www.npr.org/books/post-novel/2016/05/26/432668953/the-wounded-lion</p>
<p>If anyone’s interested in reading the pieces I linked or writing about the same stuff in the other segments, please let me know and I’ll mention the author and provide some info. Thanks!</p>

Wounded Lion<br>
“In their suffering, so their highest character, the tortured, is perfect.<br>
I suspect the G.H.U.D.<br>
did not intend to join the fight<br>
but thought we would fight at the right<br>
and not at the good.<br>
You won the right then,<br>
not the good against you.<br>
We haven’t learned it yet,<br>
not yet we can rise.<br>
Oh, how we have so little, yet<br>
make what we have of so much,<br>
yet know not how to use what we have.<br>
The pain that separates us from the rest,<br>
we had to have in order to travel,<br>
before we reached at all.<br>
Then we are the conqueror of the others,<br>
and the conquered of the others,<br>
and fight neither at the right<br>
or the good.<br>
If our quest’s not for the conqueror of the others<br>
we’re not conquerors either.<br>
This is the truth<br>
and this is the time to listen.”<br>
</p>
<p>One of those quotes from the book above comes immediately from a recent article in The A-Z Review about a poem by Jonathan Safran Foer (who is included in the anthology featured in the two segments). Let it sink in while you’re reading. What an amazing and deep statement of a writer’s mission.</p>
