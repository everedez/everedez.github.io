<h1>Ashlee Apocalypse Outfit</h1>
<p>I decided to pose him as if I were at my workbench wearing my best pair of jeans. It fits my entire body wonderfully and is not bulky at all. Also there are stripes on his clothes: yellow jeans as well as some stripes over his shoulder. As for his outfit I picked on pink and green as he seemed to be more into it. His hair color was the same, which I liked as his eyes were close together. His weapon is long, so I picked a pewter one on him. I also picked on his belt as its color was nice as well as its style. I like how his foot was also black. Lastly I just picked on the panda ears as they are adorable. The panda ears have a beautiful round one as well. They also come in other colors as per his preference.</p>
<p>His head is shaped somewhat like a panda&amp;#x27;s. I wanted to make that clear while posing him. His hair is also white, but those black and white lines were there as seen from above where they are slightly away from his face. Those are also my favorite parts of his design: the face and the eyes. I think that is also a better fit. His skin is pink and white and it matches the colors seen from above. His other parts are also pleasing in color and style. His overall head shape looks good and it blends great with his outfit.</p>
<p>I love how he finished up: he looked completely different than when I first saw him, in terms of his outfit. His clothes were also very relaxed: dark colors that make me all of the time. His arms were not over his knees and he had an over-the-shoulder gromp. Then he had a very very slight over all piece on his cloak. That made me chuckle before I started. I don&amp;#x27;t mind his smile, though. He has long and strong arms. I just love it. His eyes are very charming. I like how they stayed even. If you don&amp;#x27;t like him, you&amp;#x27;d just hate his eyes. They are what attracted me to him in first place.</p>
<p>Lastly, his feet! He walked through the office while wearing boots and a belt that showcased his entire body and showing off his silhouette: his legs as well as his arms.</p>
