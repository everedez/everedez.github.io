<h1>Taylor Giavasis Father</h1>
<p>I knew things were different when I first visited this spot. I was stunned by the strength and the courage of the people here to do this together. They are close to the sea and have no water to deal with the cold and the darkness when it comes, just because this is part of their village.</p>
<p>This father shared with me the testimonies of three of his daughters. He is here for peace, peace to all. For everyone. Here, he is just waiting. Waiting and praying for peace to come to his land.</p>
<p>When I first began to travel this path we were nearly a hundred kilometers from our village but this day was the first time we had been able to see the island with our own eyes. Yes, it was a long walk and we were without light and with no food. Thank you, God. Thank you.</p>
<p>Lionfish, octopus, land crab, and more than nine thousand spiders and their larvae. Some of all of that are never seen again!</p>
<p>We did get time to eat and see the places we were to visit. A great man, and one with many good deeds.</p>
<p>It is hard to describe a true beauty here. Amazing to see the way the light shines on the coral, the lush green area of ground vegetation, the massive growths of red and yellow flowers standing tall. There is this long stretch of rock as well, and some trees that give us beautiful sunset views.</p>
<p>There is nothing but here.</p>
<p>This village has much to offer, and that is only because they are very generous:</p>
<p>This very moment this sea-going fish was caught on a long fishing line and set out on it. It landed in the water around the lighthouse, we often saw its big white color because it was so close to that light. These fish have a mind as much as ours!</p>
<p>We do things the &amp;quot;turtle&amp;quot; way, the way of peace.</p>
<p>It was raining, and we saw people fishing at the neighboring island. They caught great fish, had turtle soup for a good meal, they had soft bread with honey and oranges.</p>
<p>
Here is a small spring. Although we did not get that many fish that day, it was the best trip ever.<br>
View from the middle of the village.<br>
Small one.<br>
The lighthouse, sea horizon, the water.<br>
