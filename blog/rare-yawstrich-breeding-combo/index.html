<h1>Rare Yawstrich Breeding Combo</h1>
<p>Yawstich Breeding Combo This combo is for single-mated yawstrings, making single string yawstrings to bridge over to the other string in the Yaw String. While there is no need or desire to use Yaw Strings, single string yaw strings tend to have a better feel for the piano player. With that said, single string yaw strings will get very thin as they take up less space. You can often hear the single string in the background when looking through the string rack. Yaw strings also tend to have a greater bending strength than yaw spline strings (strung together). You can purchase single string yaw strings in any of the following colors: yellow, red or black. The only variation in color between the two strings is the black strands in the black Yaw Strings. The yellow and red stranded strings have black strands extending out of the black strands of the black Yaw Strings.</p>
<p>Single-string yawstrings can be played by strung on the piano (via the back of a Yaw String Rack) instead of a freewheel. This is particularly helpful for barre chords and working over all the low E string intervals or harmonics. With this change, I start out playing the single strings without any attention to the harmonies. Once the chords have been built and they start to feel comfortable with the single strings, they can be strung on the piano with a full freewheel. You will hear the single strings as they are strung on the piano but, if you pay attention, they will shift to the right. This is because when a person strung the single strings with a full freewheel, the single string would be strung toward the outside and the looping toward the inside. With the Yaw String Combo, you get a whole lot more play on the strings because the first string is strung to either side!</p>
<p>The concept of using an extra string instead of an extra bar will work better on lower E notes or for chords with single notes (low E) where you want to separate out the strings so that the chords do not impact each other. As you practice laying in the chord shapes, you can try switching out the strings between the back of the piano and the Yaw String rack.</p>
