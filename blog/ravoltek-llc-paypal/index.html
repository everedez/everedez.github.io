<h3>The Invitation</h3>
<p>The Invitation, the first step in the Pathway to the Serta Gate of the Garden of Eden, is a cornerstone of Dzyan. The Invitation is the gateway through the top of the Raim, and can be used to return to your home. The Invitation can also be held in between passes, if a small hand-made cord is made of Baghire, and hung from a tree. It can only be passed in a total of 5 passes. In order to fully use the Invitation a pass cannot be made while an Invitation is held in the hand. The Invitation can be held for no longer than 30 minutes without a pass being made. There is only one pass a week.</p>
<p>The first Invitation must be held from the lowest Raim. To make the Invitation, clear your mind, press the edge of your right hand on the floor of the Rabbit, send the current of Raim through your mind, and concentrate on holding both of your hands on top of the rabbit. Hold this position until the Invitation is complete, then release.</p>
<p>The Raim is the current and the Invitation is the thread. The thread is the smooth, visible, direct Path to the Serta Gate of the Garden of Eden. On the Serta Gate, the Serts and the Ians are reunited on the River of Perfect Bliss, there is no exile or separation, nothing to keep the Serts separate from each other, or the Ians from the Serts. The Invitation can go directly through the gate.</p>
<h2>The Serta Gate:</h2>
<p>The Serta Gate is the gate, called Karmal, which opens into the ultimate garden. Here, there is no separation or exile, not any of the above, not any aspect of the world, not any action going on. There is a serenity here, called Great Bliss; it surrounds the gate and is all encompassing. Below the gate is the Tarn, but below the gate, in the Tarn, are the Serts; above the gate, in a triangle, are the Ians; in the middle are the Serts; and on the side of the triangle above the gate, stands the Serta Tree.</p>
