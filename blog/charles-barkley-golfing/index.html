<h1>Charles Barkley Golfing</h1>
<p>Great golfers sometimes make the mistake of thinking that they can hit the greens like a pro. In actuality, this is quite something else, as making golf shots takes a lot of technique and timing. The following golf shot is an example of both.</p>
<p>A “promise” shot.</p>
<p>At this point in the game, great golfers look for the natural “finish” shot. Yet, on several occasions it was not this natural finish that they hit but the natural variation of the shot after hitting the ball back over the green. The many shots you see taken as an inherent part of the game, are one of many examples of using a “variation” or a “contest” shot to create the natural finish.</p>
<p>Picture this, the green is a level one putt (or drive). Players get to see various shots into the hole on that golf course. You see a good, clean finish, and look at that. You see a half-hearted attempt at the finish but, you haven’t seen a poorly executed drop shot or false foot. You see a clean finish and you realize that it does match up visually with the golf shot you see on TV.</p>
<p>No longer does you see “another” shot in between your chosen (possible) swing and the putt.</p>
<p>And yet, you see another variation which comes off the same way the natural finish of your natural (possible) swing does. This variation is often called a “contest shot.”</p>
<p>Why? Well, you could even think of a variation as a “funny shot.” You can have fun, and see the funny ending even if you weren’t trying to hit a drop shot or a false foot. A golfing variation that usually comes off the same way your natural swing is also often seen as a great chance shot for improvement.</p>
<p>At this time when I was born, I would have been only 16.</p>
<p>A new world? In any game?</p>
