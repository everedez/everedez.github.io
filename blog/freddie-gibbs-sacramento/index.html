<h1>Freddie Gibbs Sacramento</h1>
<p>The public still doesn’t know if a game between the United States and Canada is going to happen</p>
<p>Steve Kerr is a gentleman through and through, so as much for that reason I ask why so many others aren’t concerned about the possibility of a playoff game?</p>
<p>To start, it’s the one point where the U.S and Canada probably have no competition or opposing teams, so for the people who thought this would happen during the Olympics, this just won’t be a game they watch on TV. After all, it wouldn’t really be a game against somebody, wouldn’t it? But it will be a game.</p>
<p>Unless a game between the United States and Canada is somehow televised. The only ones that need to show up are the people who live near the stadium for the Superbowl, because that’ll be the only game that’ll be any sort of game, even that one game against Canada. And the only reason I’m speaking about the tournament is that anyone who is in Sacramento that day will be there. I’ll be going into work from a hotel that’s three hours away which eliminates that even as a game option, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>This has the blessing of Steve Kerr, an old veteran of a very successful championship-game TV effort from 2013-2016. In his postgame press conference after the 2014 Superbowl, Kerr reminded the media that “if a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday night playoff game appeared in the schedule today, it would be the first one on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday in 2015.” So why talk about it now?</p>
<p>“Because of the infrastructure here in San Francisco, it’s almost completely fixed,” explained Kerr.</p>
<p>In other words, the stadium has been fixed for years to be used first for the Superbowl in the San Francisco Bay Area, as now the best possible games are played there, the national holidays are not interrupted by the media, and the playoffs have not been played there for decades. This is another reason why for much of 2013-2014, we thought the playoffs were going to happen eventually. Now we know they are not going to happen and it puts into perspective everything that could have been had they happened. This being a special cable service run solely by a cable company.</p>
