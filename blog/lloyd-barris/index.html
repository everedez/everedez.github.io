Hi everybody!<br>
Thanks for reading today&amp;#x27;s update, I hope you all did enjoy it.<br>
And I apologize for the delayed news drop for a couple of days. My kids were sick.<br>
I did get an additional dev talk on Youtube (here) and I did play some matches from the UFC &amp;#x27;09<br>
on Friday 3rd<br>
I did find out this morning that Richard&amp;#x27;s birthday is on the 27th (plus the birthday of my little sister too)<br>
</p>
<p>As you can imagine the pain of that was even more unbearable because the three of us were so young, and because only about 8 months, a year, and five months can separate a year from another.</p>
<p>So how did we manage? We worked so hard.</p>
<p>Once again we will be doing something special, because for the 2nd time in a row we are in need of a charity.</p>
<p>For our last charity outing, I will be wearing a &amp;#x27;Giants Uniform&amp;#x27; in honour of the fact that we have already done something amazing this year.</p>
<p>Actually my sister is the youngest in the family and I am the eldest. She is the one who got me into the game, who has always loved the sport and was going to do this same thing for 30 years, going on 30 or 40. I had to think long and hard before I even thought about doing this for her.</p>
<p>So this is what I basically did.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I will have my &amp;#x27;Saturday Night Saints Uniform&amp;#x27; on, in it I will be clad in the black jerseys, the Giants uniform, with some links and graphic overlays</p>
<p>I will receive my $3000 prize which will definitely go to the development of the game at the Giants stadium; along with this I will have my Sunday Saints match (alongside with our Sunday Night Avengers against the A&amp;#x27;s)</p>
<p>Thursday night I would like to do something really special, so that this never ends, I have decided to to buy the GIANTS (Giants) Away Shirt, I will enter it in the game (there are only 10 spots in the draw) and I will send it to the developers for it to get into the game.</p>
<p>Actually it has happened already. It&amp;#x27;s Wednesday and I already succeeded.</p>
