This game is very much pre-alpha, you can try testing for yourself, if you are a hardcore gamer then no doubt you will be impressed! The gameplay is very fast and actually plays pretty well for a casual level game.">

<p>This game is very much pre-alpha, you can try testing for yourself, if you are a hardcore gamer then no doubt you will be impressed! The gameplay is very fast and actually plays pretty well for a casual level game. I think the graphics are a bit of a fluke that you will have to agree with but after playing again I am quite satisfied with the graphics! You can read my impressions and what is coming together for this game in our hands on review.</p>
<h2>Controls:</h2>
<p>Move your characters(T/Q/W)</p>
<p>First thing I thought of when I saw the gameplay was the control. I thought that it would be more like a simple top/bottom camera but that is not the case. The game does move based on the direction of your character. Most people will have the game, move their characters right, left or so it seemed.</p>
<p>The way it works is that you start with a ball trying to launch a missile and grab to hit an enemy. The character then changes based on where the character lands to the enemy(tossing the ball in to the air to charge the missile). This is where I was amazed. The ball is able to move with my little mouse via touch-pad. Yes it&amp;#x27;s still the same. The main issue with this is that the mouse is on top of the screen, this means you can&amp;#x27;t do quick play modes without that issue.</p>
<p>The mouse is still a standard off the shelf button and it has your specific trigger. There is no mouse menu that you access via touch-pad, instead the mouse is button by button.</p>
<p>The second issue that I had was that the game lags and it seemed to be a bit of a problem when switching between different side missions. Almost every once in a while you will start a side mission and the movement slows or some of the characters will not move when you start a new stage. This might get fixed after some hours of play.</p>
