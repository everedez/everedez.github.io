Christen Welch Tulsa’s apartment building is located at 1115 E South Washington. The building is a 12 unit building.
Welch has a landlord named Robryse Tipp because she gave him her name. She says they both still live in the building at that address.
This is the lot adjacent to the lot the building is on. It is really close to Washington, but other than that just sort of open fields with scattered houses.">

<p>This is the view from the 1st floor a/c unit. The building was all dark green just like the main part of the building. The whole floor seems extremely closed, almost like a ghost. The view is of all the units, which have windows you can pull up.</p>

The building has it’s own parking lot on the west side so sometimes renters pull into the lot to get some lunch<br>

<p>The apartment building sits in a residential street that is filled with mostly commercial block life. You can see all the tenants living in their buildings at night. You can also see everything you would see as the towers come into view.</p>
