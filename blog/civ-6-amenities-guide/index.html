<h1>Civ 6 Amenities Guide</h1>
<p>Acquired during the War</p>
<p>War brought the first widespread adoption of this system of rationing and the first tax on commodity supplies.</p>
<p>Public water during this era was brought in, usually from running canals or rivers, frequently from a local water supply such as a municipal source. (Hence the term &amp;quot;customary&amp;quot;.) The supply of drinking water was replenished by purchasing from vendors in the marketplace. As a resource, water was generally considered as a necessary portion of the everyday needs of the populace and therefore a necessity for economic productivity.</p>
<p>
Ways to keep from having to buy (either in self-supply or marketplace purchases) in times of scarcity<br>
Ways to curb consumption<br>
Practices to be used to ensure production<br>
</p>
<p>In the peacetime time and later in the public spirit and wartime times, the citizenry (the upper 10% of the population) was generally self-supporting, depending on their own labor and industry. Many businesses were small scale and depending mainly on the production of either commodities and their sales to the poorer third. However, the status of the wealthy wealthy and more powerful that they were influenced from the wealthy middle class through much trade. Like the citizens of the City of London and the ancient City of Babylon before them, the rich in turn set about fixing prices of many consumer items to where they would be bought and sold.</p>
<p>The rich initially controlled the pricing mechanism and their own well defined needs, and those of the poor, low middle class, and lower social strata, as well as the trade with them. In the early government&amp;#x27;s time, the price of corn and grains was set at very little, and an attempt in the time of the young prince to get the people by their taxes to have enough for them to manage the cities was made.</p>
<p>In medieval or even more well known in the Classical period, the peasants or local shop keepers, who were the essential stockholders of the city as they and they were more profitable than the rich were pressured to maintain a reasonably high standard of living for themselves and their families, by reducing their food consumption or other necessities. The city allowed any peasants or shop keepers who could work hard enough to survive to have their harvest hoed before winter. Some of the best food, such as the pork that had been slaughtered for the Lenten fasts were available for sale once the seasons ended.</p>
