<h1>Saylor Hawkins Bio</h1>
<p>For a while now, I’ve been “hitting” on, looking at, and making conversation with actor and director James Feeny. Feeny has had the part of the hard-nosed, whiskey-swilling detective John Watson since the mid-1970’s, so it’s mostly by default that people know his name, of “Watson vs. Watson” by the likes of Steven Moffat and Bryan Fuller. But Feeny is just one guy, so we’re almost always left to wonder, can James Feeny play Watson?</p>
<p>For more than five hours yesterday, we visited both James Feeny and his Hollywood-set “The Witness” in their two-hour long talk. Feeny’s being interviewed, after all — it’s a star-studded program, of course. But he’s also had a lot of time to get to know his surroundings as a person.</p>
<p>We also get to understand each other in the strangest of new ways.</p>
<p>What’s something that pisses you off more than something else?</p>
<h2>James Feeny:</h2>
<p>Yeah, well. I mean, I enjoy everything just as much as anything, but I can’t really mention a single thing that I hate more than anything else.</p>
<p>Where is that?</p>
<h2>James Feeny:</h2>
<h3>“The Witness”</h3>
<h3>Shaddup.</h3>
<p>That was good. A very deep question. Where is that? Someplace, but I can’t really say. Actually, I can’t really say what. But a place that I can identify with a great deal, in my experience, is that it’s the subject matter for the subject matter. And I don’t mean that the topic has to be about something that I am personally offended or anything like that. I don’t think it should be something as superficial. I mean. Honestly. I think it’s very obvious, that there’s more “Watchers” in the world now than “Watches”. I mean, it just depends how you would define it. Because, if you define “Watcher”, yeah.</p>
