<h1>Denise Eleanor Mustang</h1>
<p>Background and career</p>
<p>Donna Marie Mustang was born the only surviving child of Edward W. Mustang IV and Mary Helen Willeford Mustang née Brewer on September 24, 1976 in Rosey, Idaho.  She graduated from Rosey High School with honors, an Honor Award, and then attended Southern Polytechnic University in Louisville, Kentucky from 1992 until 1996.</p>
<p>Married to Timothy James Mustang, who died in February 2014, she has two children, born in June 1990, and June 1991, from their marriage and the results of their adoptions.  She is retired from a position at the Rosey City Information Center.</p>
<p>Timothy James Mustang&amp;#x27;s adoption was rejected twice.</p>
<p>She currently operates the Southern Idaho Humane Society and the Mad Cow Disease Research Alliance.  She works at the Human Services at Idaho Falls and is a volunteer with Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.  She also volunteers at the Rosey City Information Center.</p>
<p>Other work</p>
<p>At age 27, she appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, hosting a radio show with the fictitious band the Broken Bells, and in 1996 was broadcast a special on Operation Yip Tsunami.</p>
<p>In 1998, she scored two additional shows: the short-lived TV series Saturday Morning With... in 1998, an as-yet-unfinished feature film titled The Thorn Birds, and in 1998, she began a second series, titled White Lies, a more factual series from the ABC network. The series lasted 18 episodes from October to December.</p>
<p>The family that appeared on the soap opera As the World Turns in the mid-1980s was responsible for one of the episodes of White Lies.</p>
<p>In December 2006, following a presentation by American public television&amp;#x27;s Washington, D.C. International Film Festival and a statewide fundraising campaign, three of the wives and girlfriends of the show&amp;#x27;s cast and crew lost their legal custody to the mother of their children. They settled out of court, for a sum of money ranging from around $62,000 per couple for a 4-bedroom home, to a total of almost $1.6 million for various properties.</p>
<p>On The Humanist Newsletter Podcast, September 12, 2010, one of the wives was given a 9.5/10 rating with listeners praising her for overcoming her alcoholism and continuing to put on the show.</p>
