<h1>Berleezy Banned</h1>
<p>Recently completed two weeks of practice. Practice and results haven&amp;#x27;t matched my expectations. I knew the head would snap when it did, but I haven&amp;#x27;t checked the neck, shoulders, elbows, and knees. They are all tightly locked with only little space for the ball. I still have 5 more weeks before I can start trying again.</p>
<p>Pajaro Valley has been pretty disappointing. I am still in the zone but don&amp;#x27;t know if I will do as well next week.</p>
<p>In other news, I am still playing my &amp;quot;comfort zone&amp;quot; offense. I practice variations of the ball (too many times), receivers, routes, and so on. I am getting used to it again. I still want to play, but I just can&amp;#x27;t seem to reach my maximum potential in whatever I am doing.</p>
<p>Right now I am just trying to get my legs and playing routes. I feel like I am getting better each day, but I want a lot more work to do on the receiver and the cornerback position.</p>
<p>
Hopefully there will be changes next week!<br>
I will be back playing by the end of the month!<br>
10/29/2009<br>
Last night I was having a great run through A-Mart, the sandpit, and a drive on the new &amp;quot;world&amp;#x27;s greatest beach.&amp;quot;<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to the drive, I was having a great time watching Jason &amp;quot;Magliano the Dentist&amp;quot; Kostzer take a well-deserved selfie of both of us on the boardwalk.</p>
<p>After another great night out of the club, I put a pretty decent impression of myself here! For this line I wanted to stay back by 20 yards to the house where I was staying at for the week at T &amp;amp; C Coats.</p>
<p>I decided I was going to swim it just as I did with my usual workout routine.</p>
<p>It was a busy night. I saw a ton of cars and pretty full service here, just as I would see a lot of cars and lots of service in a typical weekend night in Grand Prairie.</p>
<p>I drank a lot of beer and had a rough trip home. I am in such a run that I never even felt the beginnings of the heaves...they just kicked in later.</p>
