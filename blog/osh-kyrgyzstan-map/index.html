<h1>Osh Kyrgyzstan Map</h1>
<p>.The Kingdom of Osh is in Central Asia and it is known as &amp;quot;Holy Russia&amp;quot; for its emphasis on the role it wishes to play in the Eurasian Union, since the country is part of &amp;quot;Greater Eurasia&amp;quot; with a strong historical tradition in the unification of Russia and China. The majority of the population lives in the area of modern-day Khara, but some live further north in the mountain valleys in the traditional Ropar province.</p>
<p>The country is divided into six provinces: Dzo, Jalaling, Naktong, Ulan Ude, Zhuna Khas, and Yhor. Numerous ethnic groups exist in Osh, including the Korean population. Both Koryks and Ukrainians are of Korean origin and both speak Osh Roviavs’, the old Osh script. Most Koreans of Osh speak English, and are relatively well-off.</p>
<p>There are, approximately, 8 million people in the country, and 3.3 million of them live in the capital city.</p>
<p>The most important ethnic communities in Osh are the Koreans, who speak Osh Gube-onghi (an 18th century Khitan language); the Ukrainians, who speak Osh Kodor-onghi (an 16th century Khitan); the Kazakhs, who speak Osh Ulan-Bughabudjek (an 8th century Oirat language); the Alaguts, who speak Osh Baegonghi (an 13th century Oirat people); the Bashkirs, who speak Osh Kyrgyz (an 8th century Oirat language); and the Mongolians, who speak Osh Ulan-Askar-i-Khirh (an 9th century Khitan). Ethnic minorities exist in China, such as the Hurma, who speak Osh Bek’e-onghi (an 11th century Oirat language); and the Han Chinese, who speak Osh Chisora (an 13th century Oirat language).</p>
<p>The Kashag population mostly dates from the seventies, but few people still speak it, mostly because of a lack of intermarriage with Russians and Alawites. An Osh Russian community exists, though these are not as numerous as Khitan ones.</p>
