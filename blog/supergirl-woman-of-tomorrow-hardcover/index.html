<p>“The world is a dangerous place,” Kara Zor-El says at the end of her second issue of The Amazing</p>
<p>Atom magazine. Not to mention it’s a dangerous place for her new alter ego, Clark Kent. On this issue,</p>
<p>
Clark has teamed up with the latest member of DC<br>
to foil Thanagorda’s attempts at stopping the government’s plans to use Kryptonian technology to<br>
end the country’s darkest hour. Together, they’ll try to save the world from the unknown and most<br>
dangerous forces that threaten it from every angle—save a world that has suddenly begun<br>
looking like Krypton.<br>
This first issue is a perfect blend of Clark’s superpowers and those of his secret identity — taking his<br>
self-image as a common, everyday kid hero and transferring it with everything that it embodies. Kara<br>
takes her lead from the creators of the New 52 incarnation of the character, Henry Gillette and John<br>
Owen — and makes her own her own journey with Clark, one that leads up to this issue and the<br>
next one on which his future is foretold. “Most of the stuff that’s happening in the DC Universe,<br>
the new super powers were discovered by the creators and characters,” Kara says. “We’ve<br>
written that we have no idea what’s going to happen. And we’ve realized that that’s one of the<br>
baddest secrets that have ever been in print, if we write from fiction, no one’s ever going to<br>
know. For the beginning story, we set it up that these people have been doing things in their<br>
20s and 30s that nobody would know about, because the powers would be rare. We didn’t want to<br>
have a kid superhero, or a hero in his 20s who could not fly. We didn’t want to have the<br>
terrible, bad day where both Clark and Ben may be killed, in 20 years, by a terrorist firework that<br>
burned down a fairgrounds during the 1980s, because if that happened and people kept dying…”<br>
Clark is the most experienced and guarded member of the team.<br>
