<h1>Elvis Phuong Qua Doi</h1>
<p>It is not many years since Elvis was a rebel, starting his career in a way the average American teenager doesn&amp;#x27;t start. The actor was a petty criminal for the first part of the decade, but his life was turned around in the mid-1980s. There were many reasons for such a turnaround.</p>
<p>In the 1950s Elvis was released from prison where he spent time for manslaughter, assault, armed robbery and fraud, &amp;quot;amid a whole range of pressures, both criminal and non-criminal, from his often-rough upbringing with his mother and his father, his serious incarceration for drugs, his sex-offending record, his other crimes at work, his difficulties making a living at that time, and the fact that he did not get a driver&amp;#x27;s license.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Elvis, when he left prison, his criminal past went right along with his criminal behavior, with his drug habit, and even with his nickname, &amp;quot;The King.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Elvis was unemployed and lived the next nine years doing his best to put himself on a better financial footing. But after the robbery that got him out of prison, the IRS forced him to take a six-month prison sentence, on top of the nearly decade-long sentence he received for an aggravated robbery.</p>
<p>There was also the civil trial in which Elvis would go on trial, which included multiple incidents involving harassment for things like ripping off the dress code on his movie roles.</p>
<p>Elvis was released from prison in 1987 and then the actor found himself out of work for the first time and again, back in prison, at the very top of the criminal chain. In 1987 and 1988 the actor made appearances in film such as &amp;quot;Red Skies,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;He&amp;#x27;s a Man,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Last Hurrah,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Masked Rider&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;One-Eyed Woman.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>By 1992, he made a big comeback hitting the big-screen, in such films as &amp;quot;Cane creek,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;City on a Hill&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart.&amp;quot; He also starred in the ABC&amp;#x27;s and Netflix&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Rock of Ages&amp;quot;, which was followed by the theatrical film &amp;quot;What&amp;#x27;s Eating Gilbert Grape.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>A great comeback for the actor. But things began to change as he lost his edge.</p>
