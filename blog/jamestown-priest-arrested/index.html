<h1>Jamestown Priest Arrested</h1>
<p>
KEEP OR LEAVE on how to stay or escape from Mecca for an open trial. But<br>
the Hamal Inn was having trouble feeding the traveling pilgrims, whose<br>
vigilante efforts against Kaaba-tans had already taken a toll and now added to<br>
the hungry crush the pilgrims faced. Finally, the pilgrims surrounded the<br>
inn, and the shaykh was ordered to listen. That did not turn out to be a good<br>
idea. After seeing how Kaaba-tans were organizing their very own criminal<br>
squads, and despite his well-meant efforts to pass along the message that<br>
thugs wanted to see Imam Mahdi, the shaykh decided that Kaaba-tans and their<br>
Muslim fellow-travelers needed a change in priorities. So he just stayed put.<br>
But get this--in this one night he didn&amp;#x27;t just&amp;#x27;stay quiet.&amp;#x27;<br>
Sure enough the pilgrims caught and arrested Kaaba-tans on trumped-up<br>
charges of stealing stuff from Jewish pilgrims and praying in their<br>
laboratories; that was their excuse to arrest the shaykh (weren&amp;#x27;t<br>
fund-raisers supposed to be holed up in an alcohol-infused suite like a<br>
Hollywood cop?)! Uh-oh, did they think that Shlomo was going to stand in<br>
the way of what they wanted!<br>
FORD&amp;#x27;S FAVORED FOLLY<br>
Two days later, on Friday, Shomron, or Jerusalem, was overrun by the<br>
Phalanger, and later, still, by the IDF in response to the Operation<br>
Palestine Spring. By the time the army let up in Ramallah, it had<br>
already violated Shomron&amp;#x27;s annexation. Meanwhile, after his first<br>
denunciation of the occupation, Mayor Hammad Jamal called the shaykh a<br>
&amp;#x27;racist&amp;#x27; and a &amp;#x27;terrorist&amp;#x27;--just like the IDF!<br>
Just as surely, Hammad is next in line for a public execution, while the<br>
Shaykh&amp;#x27;s own mouth is filled with so much hate that even the very words of<br>
his own own followers are twisted, twisted, twisted into a lie.<br>
