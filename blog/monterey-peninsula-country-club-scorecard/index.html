<h1>Monterey Peninsula Country Club Scorecard</h1>
<p>Starlite National Golf Resort: Worth a shot for fun and a little more than regular Hilton Hotel style space but good location too. Very good course, the clubhouse is a must for anyone visiting the area. There is a beautiful waterfall in the back and on the top fairway.</p>
<p>Southern Pebble Beach Golf Course: Solid play, well worth a visit. It is the small drive that transforms the course to anything possible.</p>
<p>Saratoga Island Crossover: Bands of light on the course, good length of back nine.</p>
<p>Whittier Beach Course: About as perfect as a club could be, some holes are short with long fairways and low chipping.</p>
<p>Wetzel Beach Course: Long, empty stretch on the East end of the peninsula. It is one long, very low wooded section that is open to rough.</p>
<p>Gold Coast Country Club Course: Good holes, chipping is hard but long.</p>
<p>Torrey Pines Country Club: This really is a standard course, soft putting, but no dirt, not played often because the trees are too dense and the course very tough and demanding.</p>
<p>Lummis to Boardwalk: Good layout; under some overhanging trees!</p>
<p>Yarrow Hill, South end: This is probably the most remarkable hole, where the course narrows almost to a point and very few putts and fairways can make from the small fairway to the very end. Very amazing!</p>
<p>
Newport Beach: Good layout, two holes in tight woods and with some interesting areas in the sand.<br>
Spotswood: Short par three, long par five.<br>
Nantucket: No great holes for me, only good ones.<br>
</p>
<p>Corona-Yale Green: Extremely good of course, with two courses in the middle, you could find a hole that is a good distance from the end and yet close enough to make a game with distance.</p>
<p>Seal Beach: Top pro.</p>
<p>Playa Brava, end: Great layout, very long wooded chutes, good through line and through fairway. I wished I had putted that hole, it reminded me of a playground.</p>
<p>Horse Island crescent, end: Well run, very tight wooded fairways and a 2-shot putt.</p>
