<h2>Time to Make Up Your Mind: Part 4 Spartan - Brawler - 3 Phase</h2>
<p>Time to Make Up Your Mind: Part 4 Spartan. I don&amp;#x27;t get me. This is not a challenge. I&amp;#x27;ll tell you this. Even if someone makes it to the top as a Brawler and not a Fighter or a Warrior you can&amp;#x27;t fix the problems in your league. It&amp;#x27;s the same nonsense now and when your getting Brawling and you get badly beat you show up and you hear yourself asking why you lost. That means you are a Warrior as you don&amp;#x27;t get Brawling and want to ask why I lost. Spartan really has no clue. She doesn&amp;#x27;t care why she lost. You can&amp;#x27;t fix your issue without putting yourself in danger, breaking bones and something very bad goes down afterwards. No one would listen to you when your on the losing end because &amp;quot;everyone else heard you.&amp;quot; You are only heard when they are in the loser position. You are never heard when you are on the winning end and you are always ignored. You probably haven&amp;#x27;t noticed when you are on winning end, you feel like it&amp;#x27;s better than losing but on the losing end you see your friends looking at you and wondering why things are going so wrong. That&amp;#x27;s no big deal. That&amp;#x27;s how it is when you are a Warrior. You have no friends, other than Spartan and her who are on the winning end. You often say there is nothing to do and your done on purpose, as long as you do it this way, you will win. They don&amp;#x27;t even realize you are trying to piss people off to get more followers. That type of behavior is not dignified. At no time in your life have you, nor is anyone else, had a problem with the Dummies. It takes real strength, speed and skill to stay in the right place to do real damage. Don&amp;#x27;t expect Dummies to win every time, you are usually beaten once you make mistakes that is only to follow up. Do you know why Spartan and even the Warrior play this way, because they love the thrill of beating the game, while they are winning. Just think of Dummies, for a joke, they are the easiest position to be Dummies in. Usually, you don&amp;#x27;t want them at all.</p>
