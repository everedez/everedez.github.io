<h1>Gwen Stefani Grammys 2023</h1>
<p>Before the Grammys’ red carpet, there was a lot to discuss with this year’s ceremony. One of the nominees who wasn’t nominated was no one. Take a look, and take a listen:</p>
<p>Gwyneth Paltrow’s speech was certainly snarky, and she handled it with grace, humor, and perfection. It&amp;#x27;s the work of some of the finest journalists who have ever lived, and it was brilliant.</p>
<p>At the top of our list is New York Magazine, which last week called Gwyneth Paltrow an embarrassment and demanded that she step down from judging over her frequent criticism of the singer-songwriter, because, basically, she knew she was being snubbed. The article was written by Brian Robinson, who also has some serious career writing experience (the three-part profile series at the Atlantic is his best).</p>
<p>Paltrow announced her gender confirmation via an Instagram Q&amp;amp;A with Oprah Winfrey over the weekend, and we hope she feels a little more comfortable since making a statement.</p>
<p>Stomp, give, and stomp.</p>
<p>The tifo awards category might be the wild card this year, but it’s still a strong line up for other women who have given themselves to music and art. Mollie King and Mimi Flak were stars in the early ’00s who helped launch the careers of Bette Midler and Whitney Houston, respectively, to name a few.</p>
<p>Ella Scanlan wasn’t really given a chance at the Grammys, so she stepped into the White Ribbon Theatre this year to watch Whitney Houston as it honored her.</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping Paltrow makes it to our fair queens this year and next. What’s your favorite Grammys red carpet moment from 2017?</p>
