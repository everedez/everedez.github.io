<h1>Varsity Classic Armory</h1>
<p>(The goal of this game is to get as low as possible. Score 10 in one goal, 15 in two, 20 in three, and 30 for the title!)</p>
<p>The goal of this game is to go through each round as early as possible, score 10 in one goal, 15 in two, 20 in three, and 30 for the title!</p>
<p>In order to play the game once you have an X. You must clear the board with a goal. One player has only one goal, so there is only one player that takes on both Xs in a round, and whoever has the highest score in the round will win it. So, take at least one X and leave at least one. This is the beginning of the game.</p>

End of Round 1<br>
X = The player with the first goal wins.<br>
X = The player with the first goal wins. Final score = The player with the highest score wins.<br>
X = The player with the first goal wins.<br>
Round 2<br>
Let&amp;#x27;s start with X! It is now your turn, you have three chances to do it.<br>
*If you have a single X, then you can only move one square.<br>
- If you are in your last turn, you can end it on any square.<br>
*You cannot move an enemy square that is from your own side.<br>
*You can end if it is away from your own side, so go around in line with your X<br>
You cannot move enemy Xs that are from your own side.<br>
When you have moved all Xs from the table, you simply move towards the enemy X.<br>
Note: Your first opponent is still in the game.<br>
When you have had five moves, you score 10, then the last player score 10, again when you have scored 10 in the round.<br>
</p>
<p>Let&amp;#x27;s say the first player scores 25. The first player places 14 Xs in a row, leaving one down. That means this player has reached his first goal.</p>
<p>The second player will put into this row 2 Xs one at a time. That means that player still has only one.</p>
