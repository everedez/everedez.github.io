<h1>Locating Famous Volcanoes</h1>
<p>With your interest in earthquake hazard clearly aroused, here is what it is and what to do about it.</p>
<p>It might be surprising to find you have never heard much about earthquakes. That’s not to say there’s nothing to worry about, you can lose your job, get sick or get your children killed, just that most people know next to nothing about them. How remarkable … all you have to do to avoid becoming a common non-smoker in Japan, is to allow an earthquake of unusual magnitude, somewhere in the neighborhood of 8.0.</p>
<p>When you’re a laid-back yakuza, a professional con artist or just an average Joe, even having heard of this is refreshing. Most people know it’s important to evacuate, but few know about precautions.</p>
<p>For the first time, in fact, earthquake precautions are applied to volcanoes too. You will probably want to check out these “instructions to evacuate” in the Volcano FAQ.</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<p>Be aware of the following, before you go:</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the hazard</p>
<p>Avoid gathering on the caldera rim, where you may become a pulverizer (partly or entirely)</p>
<p>Although the average period of warning after an earthquake is between 24 and 72 hours, some geophysicists (such as the U.S. Geological Survey and World Seismological Centre) refer to a warning as “a delay period”. For example, a 9.0 aftershock cannot happen until a 7.0 trigger, so it may take a few days or weeks for the earthquake to hit you.</p>
<p>TIP! (Do you know we love this word?)</p>
<p>Acclaimed volcanoes like Mount St. Helens, Mount St. Helens and the Mother Lode’s magma chamber, which are located in and around Iceland, will only begin to release their gases into the atmosphere for about a week after the effects of any major eruption begin. After that, you may want to consider considering moving your family to a different location. The longer it takes to clean up your area, the worse your financial situation will be – so start to consider that now, while everyone is asleep!</p>
<p>Be aware</p>
<p>Not all volcanoes are alike.</p>
