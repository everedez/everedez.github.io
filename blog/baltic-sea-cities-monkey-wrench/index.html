<h2>The Video I Made Of This Tutorial?</h2>
<p>My website,</p>
<p>All the tools you will need to do this are here:</p>
<p>
The Monkey Wrench DIY Cheat Sheet -<br>
The Video<br>
How it Works?<br>
It’s really simple, in my video I’m just showing you how to make a rokinon wrench through a 1/4 wrench.<br>
The first step I simply make a 1/4 diameter circular knob, with a thread.<br>
I measure 1/4 inch halfway to make sure it is the correct size for my rokinon wrench.<br>
</p>
<p>Next, I make the handle of the wrench, going from the outside of the knob to it’s center point. Remember that the part of the wrench is not a ratchet on the handle, it&amp;#x27;s a dowel that goes into the knob. The handle has to be long enough to go into the knob, plus the handle is cut to length so you don&amp;#x27;t have to go all the way around like with a ratchet wrench.</p>
<p>
So now I finish making sure the handle is the correct size to fit into the rokinon wrench.<br>
From here, I build up the shape of my rokinon wrench.<br>
And after I got the handle to the correct size, I make the handle using a hacksaw.<br>
</p>
<p>This is a really important step for ensuring any tools you find on the internet are what they are supposed to be from the manufacturer which I always say really goes to our advantage when it comes to purchasing supplies.I take the hacksaw to my tools cabinet so I can go to the local store and make sure I have the correct tools to do this project.</p>
