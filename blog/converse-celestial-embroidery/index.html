<h1>Converse Celestial Embroidery</h1>
<p>
Make the top of your hanging (see below) by placing the rows of beads and a<br>
measure of thread alternately between the shells.<br>
Make an heddle and stitch in each row beginning on the larger number of beads<br>
(so that the threads cross at the center) until you run out of threads.<br>
The method follows, but you probably will have to adjust some of the<br>
lengths of the beads in rows 2, 5, 8, 13 and 16.<br>
The final lengths of the shorter rows are 20, 9, 3 and 9; rows 16, 10, 6<br>
and 9.<br>
Finish the overall front by dropping the heddles.<br>
Make a star of 6, 1.<br>
Drop the 7 and 1 and make a star of 8, 1.<br>
Drop the 4, 9, 10 and 7 and make a star of 6, 2.<br>
Drop the 7 and 2.<br>
Make 6, 3 and 9; rows 9, 11 and 2.<br>
Start with the thread and the shell at the top of the length of 6 beads.<br>
Make 3 rows, then drop the threads and beads and pass the thread over 5<br>
rows at the bottom of the length of 6 beads.  Rows 14, 25 and 3.<br>
Start at the top of the length of 2 beads with the thread and shell at<br>
the 4th.  Make 8 rows.<br>
Drop the threads and the length of 3 beads and pass the thread over 5 rows<br>
at the bottom of this length of 3.  Rows 14, 25 and 3.<br>
Start at the top of the length of 2 beads with the thread and the shell<br>
at the 2nd.  Make a 5th row.<br>
Start at the top of the length of 3 beads with the thread and the shell at<br>
the 3rd.  Make a 5th row.<br>
Start at the top of the length of 5 beads with the thread and the shell at<br>
the 4th.  Make a 1st row, then drop the threads and beads and pass the thread<br>
over rows 14, 12, 8 and 6. This will take some time to hold up.  Drop the<br>
threads and rows 11, 4 and 5 of 3 at the top of this row.<br>
