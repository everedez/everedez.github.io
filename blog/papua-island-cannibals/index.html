<h1>Papua Island Cannibals</h1>
<h3>History and Heritage</h3>
<p>Other than the fact, that it was all one family, there was no history to justify it. It probably doesn’t matter however, because a few generations later, no one has anything else to justify the existence of the Papuan Cannibals. They were not ever supported by political figures and have no claim to legality in any way. They are, like most things connected to Polynesia, a cultural phenomena; which has, over time, slowly faded into the collective memory.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>All in all, the structure of the Papuan Cannibals, is that of a small, stable, ancient community. This isn’t a brand new idea among the people of Polynesia, though; because all known cultures, have used a structure that has existed, for quite some time. They tend to be small, close knit and retain a few rules and regulations that are common to nearly all of the cultures that have existed on the Island.</p>
<p>There are two types of societies in Polynesia: old and the new. The old society are the ones that all of the Polynesians, from very young age, think have been around forever. These societies don’t really have any history to claim their existence by and have as their only source of authority, the natural resources of their home. These old societies have just evolved, on the journey of thousands of years, to a new pattern.</p>
<p>In the new society, most of the people don’t believe that the first societies, could have started back in 7,500 BC. Some think there were, at this early time, old Polynesian civilizations. It is extremely hard to understand the origin and ancient history of ancient Polynesians, because nothing is known, except for legends and legends make it even harder to believe.</p>
<p>If there has been any civilization earlier then the Papuan Cannibals, it probably wasn’t a Native Polynesian civilization as most are still familiar with, considering how often it has been claimed to be.</p>
<p>It is more likely that they are Caucasian, as the racial group that gives us the modern name for the planet we live on. These societies were defined as not being a great resource or civilization on the Earth.</p>
