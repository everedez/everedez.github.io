Use your powers wisely.

<h1>Spellforce Conquest Of Eo Guide</h1>
<p>
And now, I’ll show you how to conquer the Eo War.<br>
How to Win the Wars?<br>
Use your powers wisely.<br>
</p>
<p>It is relatively easy to use your powers wisely. It’s like saying to your enemies that the reason they’re losing is because they did not use their powers and thus they were weakened and suffering, but make no effort to use your powers directly. It is easier to go for the jugular.</p>
<p>Also, there is this saying in FengShui saying –</p>
<p>“One must not lightly wield a sword; one must treat it as a mighty weapon. The sword must strike from the heart, as a bell strikes from the bellows”</p>
<p>
So the sword must be sharp from the heart and yet one must be able to use it properly.<br>
In our hands, we don’t need some material thing that will give us powers.<br>
But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use what we need in order to dominate others.<br>
</p>
<p>In your “powers”, do not use them according to what you think you may get. Use them to develop yourself and form strengths. Consider the strength like a strength’s main enemy and make use of that strength to achieve great accomplishments.</p>
<p>
Herald and Spell<br>
You must wait 3 Calendar day of succession before using your spells.<br>
Besides you can’t run anymore.<br>
You can count on the summoner, because summoning is a “State” according to the Eo War’s states.<br>
In addition, you should not use your spells in the shadow of your summon.<br>
</p>
<p>In our case, we have time, so we can use them properly. For example, you might have time to go to your summon and may even summon from it. However, it is always best to “sleep” in the shadow of your summon, so you can still use your spells to dominate people in the shadows. It will be great if we have time. Please use shadow minions, so that you will be able to kill your minion and make him forced.</p>
<p>Make sure your spells are never useless, because if your spells actually help a little, it won’t be a “case”.</p>
