Information I gathered from various sources I&amp;#x27;ll be listing below are drawn from the following sources:
Myself.
Hagerman&amp;#x27;s notes.
Mikrokosmos Wiki link, for a more full list.
One might argue that two of those would be too general to apply to the Titan as a character, but I didn&amp;#x27;t have time to reach through the Atlas website and see if this had any interesting information on the character and her attributes since it has got a ton of references on the character from online sources since 2011.">

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Attack on Titan by Hrag Herman. In this website. Accessed April 2015. Hrag has definitely made some changes as far as his History page is concerned. Specifically, he dropped a lot of the gory details in the story; For instance, the second chapter of Chapter 3 was a normal chapter from Attack on Titan and not the &amp;quot;Trick of the Titan&amp;quot; this chapter where Riki battles Titan for the first time. Hrag also removed the references to the &amp;quot;Golden Box&amp;quot; from Chapter 1 in it&amp;#x27;s place; Even if it only has a general description of the box. Anyhow, this left Hrag with only enough information to write the chapter for the Titans return in a new form for chapter 4. That aspect was interesting to look into and explore.</p>
