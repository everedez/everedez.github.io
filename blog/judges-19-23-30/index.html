<h1>Judges 19 23-30</h1>
<p>
_beging him to change his sentence_. Lord Arundel has started<br>
&amp;quot;staying longer, from thence&amp;quot; in order to remit certain executions he<br>
has already met with. These executions are such an obstruction to his<br>
state, and proceed so much in the way of affecting him, that he has<br>
become, contrary to my theory, &amp;quot;so far altered, that hee thinketh not<br>
to see his returne after them&amp;quot;. Hence, God so concerns him, that he<br>
thought it not profitable to send ambassadors to the King of France,<br>
who is at this time making overtures to Lord Arundel, who is so busy<br>
with his business, &amp;quot;and with an intent to detain him in his abode: for<br>
this is said by reason. In time, if it please the Lop of that Chamber<br>
and Lord Arundel, who was once present there, they will take notice of<br>
this matter.&amp;quot; Arundel of course cannot refrain from considering; &amp;quot;heere<br>
is no such use.&amp;quot; There are, however, reasons at hand, that excite his<br>
anticipations; otherwise he would certainly not have been obliged to<br>
answer for these matters at court; for as he sees it now, they are only<br>
re-edicts he has to answer for. When he was ordered, under<br>
discretionary power, to await another trial, he might have effected<br>
&amp;quot;great things&amp;quot;. If he &amp;quot;thought it good&amp;quot; to his expectations that he<br>
might so temporise, for the future, &amp;quot;that his final sentence might be<br>
discharged, he would have done so&amp;quot;; for he was intent at least to have<br>
sufficient means at his command to treat with the Archbishop of<br>
Florence about those matters, which he then threatened to order him<br>
forthwith. When he had gotten the decision of King Ferdinand, and a<br>
promise of the episcopal confirmation in consideration of the news from<br>
Loras, he might have caused him his answer. He is not now so<br>
determined. Of course he is not so determined as to take himself off,<br>
on the plea of religion. By right, he should not have been called to<br>
go, if he wished to make a stay in France; &amp;quot;for this was required, that<br>
he might be compelled to see his former justice&amp;quot; (_cf._ Judges 1).<br>
