<p>Subject: Re: God&amp;#x27;s Hand (So much for the Old Testament). Got the following answer for some one who thought its blasphemy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I work with the PCCI, one of the biggest Jewish organizations in the country. For $25/mo, we have an NPO that has the staff, the computer, and some of the best scribes around. It&amp;#x27;s a great program. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; They have everything you want. It was strictly business hours. Yes, it worked. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; OK. I think it was a result of the &amp;quot;hands on&amp;quot; approach. Since I was there just the morning of the explosion, I wanted to get it completely off my chest. It&amp;#x27;s the exact response that people around here used to get. With that said, from an NPO point of view, that&amp;#x27;s priceless. The &amp;quot;silent explosion&amp;quot; call is a bit late. Also, the &amp;quot;the second site&amp;quot; was the fault of the NPO which has, in past years, been a front for the Israeli Mossad. The Mossad was responsible for one of the first-incidents of the bombings (what some would call the first Muslim terrorist). I&amp;#x27;m not convinced that Jews are necessarily to blame for either, because people before them have gone through the &amp;quot;Jewish troublemaker&amp;quot; phase. You had three attacks in Mumbai, Malaysia and Beirut in that span of time. I would go back to the beginning and ask for the first ones to come out of the Jewish &amp;quot;troublemaker&amp;quot; phase and then point out the Mossad had nothing to do with the strikes. The point I don&amp;#x27;t get is, why did people who truly believed what they were telling the other world leaders (who supposedly know the situation) think such a thing was valid? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I wouldn&amp;#x27;t blame yourself for that. Only God knows the end of things as it relates to His plan. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I don&amp;#x27;t know what you mean by doing that, and you are being very condescending to me. I am not asking you to change your beliefs. I am pointing out, you may be an anomaly in this area, but until this is corrected, you should not make suggestions which could possibly be misconstrued as a radical shift in your own beliefs. Those are suggestions.</p>
