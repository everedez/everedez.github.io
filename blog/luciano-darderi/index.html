<h1>Luciano Darderi</h1>
<h3>Gian Darderi/Mayo Clinic</h3>
<p>The history of Italian men who became doctors is intertwined with the history of medicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Gian Darderi, a close friend of both Giuseppe Tucci and Federico Guli (see later), became a professor at the Mayo Clinic and served in a variety of prominent roles in the medical world across the United States, Mexico, and Italy. He was a longtime consultant to NASA&amp;#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory where he was responsible for training a huge number of scientists that later advanced science and medicine. In his free time, Darderi collected Italian and American foods, flowers and plants, and kept a home-to-home catalog of exotic specimens, the contents of which are given below:</p>
<p>TUBECOLONIUM (now referred to as an Australian fossil cactus) has the world&amp;#x27;s richest collection of lichens.</p>
<h2>GEOGRAPHISTHOOD:</h2>
<p>The true explanation for the global distribution of Australia&amp;#x27;s plants that eventually gave rise to the world&amp;#x27;s first nationalities of India, China, Japan, Korea, and the West Indies in the history of Indian culture is a modern scientific discovery. By looking closely at a particular type of lichen, the phylogenic results proved that it had originated not in a landmass nearby but rather in Australia itself.</p>
<p>What is so interesting about this discovery is that it proves that, no matter where they might have come from, the lichen are all related to the source of Australia&amp;#x27;s first population, which in turn, gave rise to the continent&amp;#x27;s indigenous cultural influences.</p>
<h2>HONARIUM</h2>
<p>The term &amp;quot;hontarium&amp;quot; is derived from the Latin word &amp;quot;hymenalis,&amp;quot; which means &amp;quot;marriage&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;engagement&amp;quot; of the soul, and which later was used to refer to the actual marriage of Christians. While the word is still used to describe a small gothic wedding, most modern understanding defines the hymenal marriage as a legally binding union between a Christian and a non-Christian, where the first one (either the clergyman, or a bride/bridegroom) is a Christian by heart/conscience and the latter is a non-Christian. A variety of people of non-Christian faiths can be married into the clergy.</p>
