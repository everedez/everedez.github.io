<h1>Councilman Devyn Keith</h1>
<p>
Local Ward: 2<br>
Name: Donald<br>
District: Ward #3<br>
Father: Albert Keith Jr.<br>
Mother: Albert Keith Sr.<br>
Vacancy: Shipment filled<br>
Mother’s age: 62 years old<br>
Father’s age: 56 years old<br>
</p>
<p>Vacancy filled: Ward #2 and three Councillors: James Carpenter, James Thomson, and James Wylie (who was first elected in 2000)</p>
<p>
Date on record: November 3, 2010<br>
Prior election: November 22, 2008<br>
Question Date: August 29, 2010<br>
Question: Do you support the recommendations of the Master Plan for the area?<br>
</p>
<p>Answer: “Yes. I do. That’s how I voted in the November election.</p>
<p>I applaud the efforts of all the residents who put their time and energy into creating that master plan. It’s a very serious project. It has brought together quite the a collection of very impressive and diverse people, good planning, and good results.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say that the Master Plan was presented for public scrutiny and approval, and that’s something that should not have been taken lightly. There’s been great discussion here and the results of that discussion ought to be clear.</p>
<p>I’ve heard (many) residents saying, “It doesn’t do a good job of delivering the expected results.” Others say that an administrative task force needs to review the plans, and that makes it necessary and beneficial to have some sort of technical analysis. This should be done; the results should be available. That’s what the master plan is doing.</p>
<p>On a more technical point, it should also be said that this is a master plan. It should be possible to build affordable housing if people want to do so. You can’t have a master plan and then have developers come into the city and tell the city to take a different course. To tell the city to do something where developers are there to profit. And that should not be allowed. You can’t have this sort of thinking.</p>
<p>I’ve voted in the past on issues regarding development, and I will continue to do so. That’s what I am doing.</p>
