Chersh Linden is the most likely candidate amongst bitcoin photographers. The difference is in his method and his vision. He is also a successful artist, an accomplished mechanic and one of the best mechanics I have heard of and seen.">

<p>Chersh Linden is the most likely candidate amongst bitcoin photographers. The difference is in his method and his vision. He is also a successful artist, an accomplished mechanic and one of the best mechanics I have heard of and seen. He is also very cheap, is very casual around people, but very courteous, yet still pleasant.</p>
<p>He is an experienced engineer as well as a designer, programmer and developer. He has also been working in the software industry since 1994 but he is no longer in the day to day work. He is listed on several exchanges at which he works and even the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; forum. In less than six months he has had his artwork printed directly through his own facility and sold in approximately 250 countries. He is well known beyond his country for his support of &amp;quot;The Monetization of Photography&amp;quot;, which has been very successful. This is probably the most important aspect of &amp;quot;Chersh Linden&amp;quot; as it is usually the only thing that a serious photographer cares about, even if that doesn&amp;#x27;t mean much because it is his own passion and he really feels that their is a need. In his photography - as seen in the prior post I did him a favor. It is important to make this public to show other photographers how serious he is.</p>
<p>We had the opportunity to ask some questions while he is down in South America and we tried to get to know him a little more. Please join me and the other forum members in thanking him for this new adventure. Thanks and enjoy.</p>
<p>We know some of you are new to bitcoin and are curious in how Bitcoin works and some others are a bit fearful and want to know how it has grown. To be candid, if I couldn&amp;#x27;t make any money with this then I would feel differently, I love money and being able to control it is one of my biggest pride.</p>
