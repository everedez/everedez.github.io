<h1>Chaos Ruler, The Chaotic Magical Dragon</h1>
<h3>Script</h3>
<p>[*REQUEST FOR MAGICAL KINGDOM*][*REJECT*][*MAY*][*AUTORIZED CHAOS REIGN]] This summons a magical kingdom, one for you to rule.] --Your Dragon!------</p>
<p>[*4th Dummy &amp;quot;Blobby&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Purge-Balls&amp;quot; to speak to you] Give him a command, [KEEP ORDER-QUIT, REPEAT] and keep trying to do so as long as his command persists.--Capsule! Put the treasure inside the treasure chest! That, your dragon and his fellow make up the &amp;quot;Dummy Brigade,&amp;quot; your loyal henchmen. They will speak to you with an appeal to your magical understanding. All the Dummy Brigade wants is to find out that the false magician who has torched their precious treasure is indeed your friend, the perfect disguise.*] Bwahaha!! The Dummy Brigade made up of the four Magic Kingdome Dummy Warriors finds themselves in your possession, but suddenly out of a fit of anger the leader, Blobby angrily shoves Blobby&amp;#x27;s hand to make Blobby put his hands to his mouth so that everyone can hear Blobby&amp;#x27;s [*BABY*] voice... Giggity Giggity! And you&amp;#x27;ve got a strange [*ZOO*] monster in the form of that great great great great-great great-great great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of a King.</p>
<p>
Blobby<br>
------- Blobby&amp;#x27;s personal thoughts ---------------------------<br>
“You people aren&amp;#x27;t ready for our presence yet, are you?”<br>
--a strange voice<br>
“My command!”<br>
</p>
<p>In the moments before you appear, there is a series of clues left by your servants. These clues might give you a hint on how to find out on what island or location of this magical kingdom you are now in. For example, there is one clue about a sword that needs to be found on the island called “Aeudii”. Another clue on the island is that their “Effk-Kun” is on the island too. The source of the dragon’s power is here. The heroes stand here next to the Dragon King.</p>
