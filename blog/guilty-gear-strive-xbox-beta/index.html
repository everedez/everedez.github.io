<h1>Guilty Gear Strive Xbox Beta</h1>
<p>
A while back I mentioned in this thread that we were thinking about an early Guilty Gear Strive Stride.<br>
And then of course, it never happened.<br>
We finally started working on it like the years have gone by: the KISSMAXX (Kissmaster Alpha Mobile Game) Strive Stride.<br>
Mesmerizing.<br>
</p>
<p>As we talked over the weekend about it (among other things), it never went through for whatever reason. A pretty open explanation would be that we were always wanting to “maximize” the console’s overall resolution.</p>
<p>Which unfortunately, although not impossible in games is also ridiculously easy to do in games right now. But it is indeed a potential issue, especially for such big publishers as ours.</p>
<p>At present, making a proper proper Strive Stride requires a considerable amount of work and the size of the console’s CPU is extremely limited. But we’ve still been able to make it at all.</p>
<p>The final product is basically just a front face mirror with an angled view of sorts. Basically made to look like it just popped off the back of some sorts of a sports car.</p>
<p>Now, this is not an expensive “making” accessory, just a thing that we had that we liked well enough at the time.</p>
<p>Now I’m pretty sure I can’t really improve upon it either since I got it in this condition out of the blue and it’s been a long time since I have anything like that.</p>
<p>But this all of course is besides the point. This is a product as beautiful as it is small.</p>
<p>One that would be completely overplayed by a few people, perhaps because the thing is just looking small, but hey, they can also live out of boxes right?</p>
<p>It is very, very beautiful.</p>
<p>P.S. To those people that, like I said, think I can’t improve upon this:</p>
<p>In the words of its “creator”, over the weekend we actually finally started working on it just like the years have gone by: The Kissmaster Alpha Strive Stride (KISSMAXX Strive Stride).</p>
