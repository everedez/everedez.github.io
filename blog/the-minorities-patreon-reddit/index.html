Chapter 3: Telling About Race At War
Following a prolonged period of having no clear information about one’s own or a group’s race in the World to come for the entire span of one’s life, a time in which a child’s “natural” color may often prove to be unforeseeable, our curiosity about the matter is piqued.">

Chapter 3: Telling About Race At War<br>
</p>
<p>Following a prolonged period of having no clear information about one’s own or a group’s race in the World to come for the entire span of one’s life, a time in which a child’s “natural” color may often prove to be unforeseeable, our curiosity about the matter is piqued. Having met some former members in the past, such as The Wandering Friar in Chapter 3 of The Minorities Unite, there is only one suggestion that The Wandering Friar knows of himself/sheself as being of some native or part native blood, although what that actually means in specific terms is unclear. However, he is generally assumed in the general population to be of either Latin American, Canadian, British Isles, or Eastern European descent, and this is based, on the reader’s best understanding, on his appearance, his experiences, his personality, and from other biographical aspects. This is subject to shift when members of the wandering friar’s past are present, but at this point there is only one suggestion being made for the wandering friar’s race and/or ancestry. If he is of some Latin American or Canadian Hispanic blood in addition to his “natural” part European, that is new information. The wandering friar has not stated clearly (nor was there any need to at this juncture) what his nationality is or, if he is a member of any of the other international community of people represented in the story, what nationality or ethnic or racial background belongs to him. Members of the community have indicated that, if members of the community are from the same world, they may all speak the same language, have the same dialect, wear the same or similar clothing, etc., with the exception of the woman who was with them when she originally met the wandering friar. When “They” include all women, that becomes unusual. At this point, gender is not given by the narrator nor in all the members of the community. This particular discussion then continues as new information comes to the narrator’s attention and the vagaries of the manuscript add new details.</p>
