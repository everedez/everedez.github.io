<h1>Woodward Ave Brookline Pa</h1>
<p>According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( US CPSC ) reports the death of 10-year old Tishiki Williams during store closing due to the presence of cigarette (NT) lying on top of her.</p>
<p>State law requires the closing of any retail establishment, or other point of sale location, that is failing to remove or replace a banned substance or substance which may cause</p>
<p>harmful exposure to combustibles and substances</p>
<p>that may present an unreasonable risk of serious personal injury. On or about December 18, 2016, NT was found on top of Williams and pinned to the ceiling by a store employee, causing Williamsâ€™ life-threatening head injuries and other complications. While Williams was held on the floor and kept unconscious for at least four hours, the store employee ended the incident without summoning medical assistance.</p>
<p>Williams suffered extensive burns on her body, requiring medical treatment which included the loss of more than two million dollars in hospital and outpatient expenses. Williams will be sorely missed by all of her family, friends, and community, and her death is the unnecessary tragedy of careless store employees.</p>
<p>The business owner of the CVS Pharmacy located at 4360 Brooker Ave at Brookline is conducting an investigation to determine if Williams or any other customers who may have been present during her incident were at any risk and should have been summoned to the store.</p>
<p>If you have any information leading to the identification of the store closure perpetrator, you are urged to contact the CVS Pharmacy at 347-655-4536 or the Brookline Police Department at ( 703) 439-4444.</p>
