<h1>Fredia Payne</h1>
<h3>Bio:</h3>
<p>Well, that ‘new daddy’ is new to the show but to see a suntan, I would have to say Robby from Austin, Texas. He has a back tattoo (did not get a picture of it) with his initials and a big smile. Also, he said he wants to see us once more.</p>
<p>Flailing your legs in the river is to get high. You can have as much or as little as you want. People have said, too, that you don’t want anything but that ‘boot’ of yours in the river. It can be a bit of a turn on to get that far, then throw the line out and ride back down. At least some do, anyway,</p>
<p>At one time, you had to come off the river through a fog bank to get to the fishing line. We got that in Serenity and other places, too.</p>
<p>I think it is ‘harder’ now because you have no choice but to use a float tube, so that the ‘little girl’, and ‘boy, you are a beautiful boy’ can pass by. More importantly, I was told some time ago ‘don’t say “Dollywood” in town, she can’t stand you but she don’t like the idea of me hanging out at Dollywood.’</p>
<p>My nickname in South Dakota was: The Big Red One with a hole in the head. Not a big hole but enough to throw up from. They didn’t think they could handle me. LOL</p>
<p>I run on the beach every morning, down the coast, across the river and up again on the opposite side of the river when I am done on the shore. My eyesight’s good with one sight or the other.</p>
<p>I was given the nickname the “Big Black” from ‘dibba dibba dum dab‘ (talk among yourselves).</p>
<p>On my knees are some flowers, two of them. One has become a rose, one a tulip.</p>
<p>I always come into town Sunday, most of the same folks as on a Saturday. This is partly the reason I stop. The weather permitting, of course. On a Saturday, the folks seem a little quieter.</p>
