<p>September 11, 2001, a quake struck the Mexican border lands and killing at least some 700 people. Approximately 1,500 Mexicans migrated to Mexico, because the death rate in Mexico was nearly double that for the USA. The quake was the largest in history on Saturday, and the epicenter was in the Tectonic Zone 7 between Antahuacán and Frontera del Leche, stretching from Mexico City all the way south to El Paso. The magnitude of the quake was 7.5. On Monday, 7,000 people from 10 towns near Antahuacán and the Mexican border were brought to a displaced camp in the desert. Their belongings had been stolen by highway robbers. Most of the people inside the camp had been living in tents, but some of the water supply had just been temporarily isolated because of the earthquake.</p>
