<p>When a friend asked me about this week’s upcoming Women of Miami initiative, I wasn’t sure what to expect. After all, I know nothing about the women in the community I serve and have few opportunities to work with them. I soon learned that although women in the community are made up of many diverse and not gender-defined groups, there are both men and women of color in every group. I sat down with one of the Miami women I serve, Vanessa Alvarez, to explore some of the communities that are primarily made up of color… so give it a try if you’re curious.</p>
<p>A few days before we met in June to announce the initiative, I asked her to give me a list of a few groups that are predominantly comprised of color in our community that would be of interest. I can now make a more comprehensive list of the groups we are reaching:</p>
<p>
African-American Women United in Action<br>
Daughters of the American Revolution<br>
Women of the Civil War<br>
Women of the Women’s Political Caucus<br>
Women of the Patriotic Women’s Leadership League<br>
Women of the Dixiecrats<br>
Asian American Women United in Action<br>
The Miami Dade Chapter of the Color Equity Coalition<br>
The Florida African-American Republican Women<br>
Miami Black Women for Justice<br>
Women of Color Network<br>
African-American Women United in Action<br>
Sixty-Second City<br>
Women of the Daughters of the American Revolution<br>
Delray Beach, The<br>
Hialeah, The<br>
The Florida Keys<br>
Freedom Movement Coalition<br>
Florida Women Democrats<br>
</p>
<p>In February, the Women of Miami initiative was announced on Facebook as follows:</p>
<p>“On July 31, 2017, we are launching Women of Miami, dedicated to helping bring lasting change to our diverse community and culture. We will focus on three focus areas: Women, Urbanization, and Race.”</p>
<p>Miami is one of the largest cities in the United States to be named as one of America’s “Most Racialized Places.</p>
