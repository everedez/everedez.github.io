<h1>Otter Street Fisheree 2023</h1>
<p>Away from the city limits, the rural area still has two former train stations. These two buildings are not to be missed due to the nature of the terrain and the facilities of the train station itself. Be it a tram, train, bus, driving car, you will find this farm tucked away beneath the vegetation that stretches to beyond the horizon. From this remote location you can easily take a stroll on your way to or from the city. With a detailed history of the site, you will find a little piece of Eastern North Carolina history hidden here and here in the heart of Appalachia. From the farm, there is a glimpse into the past from these amazing pictures.</p>
<p>Farmsteads can be found in different locations. The original two residences are found near the scenic waterfalls. The old railroad tracks run from the one of the railroad lines at this location. Also on this scene is the actual building called The Farmhouse that houses the original second house. The two houses all lie right above the railroad tracks. These twin locations are still in use and are open for day tours, and night tours to visitors. The tours are extremely affordable as most of the building are not open for tours so those who would like to go in and see inside are able to on a tour. Having a visit is enough to see the beauty of what was once a place that people spent many nights and nights just to get away from everything. When you leave the main part of the site, you will see an amazing view as to how a space would have looked 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Enjoy a peaceful calm, get out your camera and capture the moments to remember.Here is what will truly capture your heart. This is what allows a place to continue to be a fantastic tourist destination - it always captures the essence and the history of Appalachia. Stunning photos taken by various photographers capture the beauty of the location and the past - just trying to put it into words is just that - simply amazing.</p>
<p>Museum of the Blue Ridge Parkway Railroad Museum</p>
<p>The railroad museum provides for visitors a wide range of exhibits from the life and events of the railroad to the rolling green steel of the trains that make use of the area. The history of the parkway is a wealth of information that is great to know.</p>
