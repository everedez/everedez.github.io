<h1>Spellforce Conquest Of Eo Wiki</h1>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Doom Patrol had a lot of time to finish building it during it&amp;#x27;s preparation for its launch back in Summer 2012. Sometime in the middle of 2011, though, something caught my attention and got me interested in becoming the partner for it.</p>
<p>I have had a couple of short stints running online for a few years now and I haven&amp;#x27;t done it for more than a year. For me the online part had always been something of a flop or a gimmick for a hobby website. Besides, who wouldn&amp;#x27;t want a website with great quality pictures (I prefer real life pictures), in great focus around specific characters, good general fanart, plus something of a forum if I were to run a website myself?</p>
<p>I can&amp;#x27;t wait to get this process started on a forum and from there, expand it into a full website. After filling in a couple of details, such as the forum&amp;#x27;s website and forum rules (I&amp;#x27;ll explain that in the &amp;quot;about&amp;quot; section, but for those still reading this introduction, you can go to that directly).</p>
<p>I have a couple of quick questions now. Do want to extend an invitation to some people to join our site or do want a word with you?</p>
<p>First thing first: we don&amp;#x27;t really have much time before we have to build the site, so we would prefer that you guys join us in those hours. We have not put a deadline on anything, so we&amp;#x27;ll just keep that an open question. Thanks again and I hope to see you in our forums very soon and it&amp;#x27;s nice that we can be like, by the numbers, friends on this website.</p>
<p>Here with all this talk, first thing is the rules.</p>
<p>1. Start by saying hi. Or by following the original site title.</p>
<p>2. If you want to join the site, you will be notified soon about how to sign yourself up.</p>
<p>3. If you want to request an intro line, something like &amp;quot;Mr. E, you want to join our Discord?&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;we have many people joining and doing stuff here&amp;quot; wouldn&amp;#x27;t work, I understand. I am trying to emulate who you all are here, and the format of &amp;quot;Please e what?&amp;quot; will be in use in the future to bring you into the Discord channel.</p>
