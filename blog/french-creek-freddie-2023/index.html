<h1>French Creek Freddie 2023</h1>
<p>The Season 3 cast reveals a season full of excitement and surprises. Notable exits include the time-traveling gazillionaire Stan Everitt playing Jack Savage, Poussey Shore’s Aisha Grace and the three-hour stand up series The Brothers Bloom, directed by writer of All the Things She Said, Megan James. And yes, at the end of the season, we’ll see James tell us what it was like to work with Jamie Norton.</p>
<p>Last week, I announced that I&amp;#x27;d interviewed Poussey Shore star Jamie Lynn. Last night, the IADC cast announced their roles for the 25th season. And last but not least, Season 3 comes to a close with a brand new guest. All The Things She Said&amp;#x27;s Ann Meredith Dillard will join an already packed cast as Nadia Fox. You know, the one and only who I like to do all the talking about. And if there&amp;#x27;s one person who can give me an imaginary source for the rest of my insane life, all I&amp;#x27;ll have to do is follow all the people who follow Jamie Lynn. Yes, that&amp;#x27;s her.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m also thrilled to announce that the final episode of Season 3 is going to feature a full-hour skit with a role I know you will love. Seriously. I&amp;#x27;d love to see it. How can you not love... Jamie Lynn? Get excited, you two!</p>
<p>Want to get an early glimpse into our next season? I&amp;#x27;m holding an exclusive interview with the cast of The Brothers Bloom for season 3! Join IADC: On Showtime next Tuesday when the cast of the hit TV show returns to the comedy set. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>5) One actor&amp;#x27;s crazy week as Jamie Lynn</p>
<p>Starting with the opening episode, Jamie Lynn is back as Nadia Fox. From the moment this whole thing took place, it was hard to believe that she was just like her older sister, Mia, who we saw in The Last Ten Days, while Jamie got to tell her life story. She has a young son, so I can&amp;#x27;t imagine it being a burden to her, especially since Mia was more concerned about her kids. I don&amp;#x27;t get Mia, but I&amp;#x27;m not sure if that&amp;#x27;s her personality as well. Jamie Lynn finally landed a gig with one of the biggest soap empires in the world.</p>
