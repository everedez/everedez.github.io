I don’t really like to do my own stunts on camera – mostly because I never really learned a lot and I grew up fighting in a gang and was in and out of jail for some time, so when something I did caused a huge response in this forum, my first response was “nope nope nope.">

<p>I don’t really like to do my own stunts on camera – mostly because I never really learned a lot and I grew up fighting in a gang and was in and out of jail for some time, so when something I did caused a huge response in this forum, my first response was “nope nope nope.” Now, a person can feel free to interpret that to mean that I would do it every other week, every other day, every other minute, every other hour, and such, but I really don’t want to do it. I wouldn’t argue that it’s an effective means of “making people talk,” (I wish I’d learned how to do that), but I think some people would hold me to it. Even when a stunt might be effective in making someone feel good about themselves, I don’t believe that would ever be something I do when filming anybody else in public (except for actual “heroes”). Having recently, unsuccessfully attempted to film four girls falling down a hole, I can answer those questions quite definitively: NO. It would never be something I would ever participate in.</p>
<p>Question: How often do you jump in front of cars? That doesn’t really sound much like what I’m used to doing.</p>
<p>See, that’s another story – I’ll explain. I never jump in front of cars unless it’s directly in the line of fire. I usually watch people crash, not drive, and I know what I’m talking about. Watching a driver go through traffic is always much pleasanter (and there are some people that are more skilled than me, but there are also some skittish drivers too) than watching an individual roll down the hills in front of me.</p>
<p>Besides that, I don’t normally fly.</p>
<p>Question: Do you cry when someone cuts you down?</p>
<p>No, this is not a lie – I do very little crying. I like to see everyone with great reactions and people smiling with pride. My favorite thing to say?</p>
