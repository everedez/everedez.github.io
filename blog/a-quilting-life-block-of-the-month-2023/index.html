<h1>A Quilting Life Block Of The Month 2023</h1>
<p>Twenty-three years ago...</p>
<p>My initial instinct when I picked up the magazine was to throw it across the room because I knew it was a quilt block for me, but being a pre-dawn kind of me I&amp;#x27;d only just realized it made sense to take what it said seriously. Once again another quilting friend had asked about making a large pattern for me (she had not previously known to do quilts of any size) and to my surprise it was on the front cover!</p>
<p>Now, my first thought was that I should become a pattern quilter but that thought was quickly displaced by my amazement at how wonderful the designer was. I got the basic shape in as I went but I definitely didn&amp;#x27;t make it as is.</p>
<p>I studied her book carefully then sent the pattern off to her and asked her to point out any places I could improve. My old patterns kept me out of my happy zone for a while but as I read how the blocks were built together I grew excited (except perhaps that day I had the flu!) and so I made a few changes. Of the changes, all but two were ones that would definitely not be in the finished product.</p>
<p>Luckily, if it weren&amp;#x27;t for my pre-dawn niggle I&amp;#x27;d still have had the block and I&amp;#x27;d be keeping it.</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s simple - it&amp;#x27;s block two to my 10-block puzzle!</p>
<p>I started the Quilting Life Block Of The Month 2023 quilt with a base for this project and for quilting. I can&amp;#x27;t count what a great deal that was. It includes a blue backing for the quilting and grey for the binding (both are easy to find). The grey is also great for binding future blocks and pattern quilts.</p>
<p>
Start by piecing your bed or base together and then add your quilting and binding to the background.<br>
You will find the book at Lido. Here&amp;#x27;s what the section called &amp;quot;Add this picture&amp;quot; has to offer...<br>
It has a great photo for those who do not find a certain image to work for.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough to discover the block&amp;#x27;s design you will find a blank space to fill with your own little quilting or binding masterpiece.</p>
