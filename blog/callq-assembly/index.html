Abstract
Assembly is a High-Level abstract Machine Programming language. It is based
on the type-level abstraction by providing at any given time a class-level
machine which performs a single operation. Assembly uses this abstract
level to represent the same level as the (class-level) syntax.
Additionally it is controlled by a builtin lexer, an implicit message-writer,
a constant runtime interpreter and a number of metaprogramming facilities.

Abstract<br>
Assembly is a High-Level abstract Machine Programming language. It is based<br>
on the type-level abstraction by providing at any given time a class-level<br>
machine which performs a single operation. Assembly uses this abstract<br>
level to represent the same level as the (class-level) syntax.<br>
Additionally it is controlled by a builtin lexer, an implicit message-writer,<br>
a constant runtime interpreter and a number of metaprogramming facilities.<br>

While there are several variations of Assembly in the literature and in<br>
the online compiler forum discussions, it will be recalled that the goal<br>
of Assembly is to express efficient high-level code and not to use<br>
&amp;#x27;inline&amp;#x27; assembly language.<br>
In principle Assembly could be compiled into native machine code by a<br>
small &amp;quot;insetter&amp;quot;, however it has poor performance in the size of the<br>
source code, and some operations (particularly operations with over-flow<br>
arrays) are impractical to inline. Instead of inline assembly<br>
instruments such as the assembly interpreter at the end, you can use<br>
CAS [Computer-Aided Software Engineering] and/or vhdl-tools to compile<br>
Assembly or generate native machine code. The following example<br>
provides an alternative approach which does not generate native machine<br>
code or directly compile the code in, but is a wrapper around the native<br>
machine code and interpreters. For further information about compiling<br>
Assembly this syntax is relevant.<br>
(The following note is a description of the type-level abstraction.<br>
If you are interested in type level language see also a section on Basic<br>
Instruction set. Note that the abstract syntax is a low level.<br>
By convention low-level language (or low-level assembly language, and<br>
at any given time a.la extension to that language) is separated into at<br>
least two levels. At the lower level is either code or a type-level<br>
abstraction, and at the higher level you have a general collection of<br>
operations. This collection is just referred to as a &amp;quot;language&amp;quot;.<br>
