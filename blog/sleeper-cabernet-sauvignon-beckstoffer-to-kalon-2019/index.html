<h1>Sleeper Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer To Kalon 2019</h1>
<p>The story is simple, just a straight throw of the dice is what we got.</p>
<p>We call this SPAK because our dad said “a sleeping cabernet shouldn’t have all the romance of a red top”. So we threw it out the window.</p>
<p>We will be bringing it back full of space and freshness with added peppercorns and aged citron from Gala Vista. We are sourcing vintage grapes from Italy here in Oregon not far off the vineyard from Chanto and Sonoma.</p>
<p>We are pairing two of our favorite vintage cabernets here with our favorite grapes. You will notice that we switched from a chardonnay to a meritage bordeaux blend. This was the winning choice and we didn’t want to risk any exposure in the winery. The new vines were grown in the La La Garosa vineyard in Paso Robles, California and these cabernets were aged in bourbon barrels before being blended here at Cabernet. The Meritage Wine Blend will now be sold in your favorite wine shop and we hope you all will seek it out.</p>
<p>Our “Full of space and freshness” that we mean was a throw of the coin and we love the buzz we got as we tasted the different labels and paired the right wine and at the right time. We are calling this full of life.</p>
<h2>Aurora Gardens Cabernet</h2>
<p>Aurora Gardens Cabernet is a pure beauty at just under $15 from the shores of Santa Cruz Island. Our family had the privilege of visiting this winery, one of the most amazing wineries in the world and also a new winery since we purchased the winery. The winery focuses on producing premium cabernets and we are beyond excited to bring you this wine. You all know that you have to love quality and this winery has no filler or shortcuts to making a top-notch cab wine. That is just what this is.</p>
<p>Cabernet produces a brilliant intensity in this wine. It is smoky with stone fruit flavors and bursts with its deep acid complexity, reminiscent of a higher quality Pinot Noir. We are excited to pair it with oak barrel aged chenin blanc and a glass of Gala Vista Chablis.</p>
