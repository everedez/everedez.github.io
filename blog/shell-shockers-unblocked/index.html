Shark Attack - Channel 5<br>

News Online<br>
The sensationalistic drama that ignited an international scare for<br>
The Office was left to curl up in its grave by critics, never penetrating<br>
the open marketplace of television for its outlandish (and without precedent in<br>
British television), and has been forgotten during the succeeding lull period in<br>
British television.<br>
In her well-researched and incredibly sensitive documentary The<br>
Shark Attack, Sharon Oakley investigates The Office’s love-hate drama that dealt<br>
with ‘frustrated sexual relationships’ between various members of the series<br>
and then played into sex panic in the nation, with a six part running time slot<br>
(with more at Christmas?) hosted by David Mitchell&amp;#x27;s Scott Mabin.<br>
Opening with a press conference with the show&amp;#x27;s director Deborah Pella, it shows<br>
that the concept was conceived in an attempt to put some distance between the<br>
teams, particularly Michael McIntyre, who had no legal contact with Edna &amp;amp;<br>
Eileen, or anyone else, much less sex addicts whose behaviour had been featured<br>
in the show.<br>
The purpose of what came across as an audition scene involving the team in their<br>
lewd office - clearly the location of last season&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;Invisible Women&amp;#x27; - was to<br>
ensure viewers could see a real sex addict - with much darker complex<br>
problems - thus providing the catalyst for social embarrassment.<br>
And yet from the documentary come to light some disturbing details, such as<br>
that the role-playing in the building was not exactly that of a mental health<br>
staff, or even of the series itself.<br>
It was more like David Mitchell himself - who has a medical condition that causes<br>
him to crave sexual images - and his entourage.<br>
Most importantly of all, it meant that the ‘frenzied’ tensions in the room were not<br>
lonely.<br>
OAKLEY: Mr Mitchell himself admitted this was<br>
not exactly the real events in the show&amp;#x27;s office, it was reality.<br>
