Yes, we really did count.

<h1>Sba Targeted Grant Program 2023</h1>
<p>Enrolling was by mail and sent on to the right person. We asked applicants to tell us about their experience applying for Sba target grants. We received response from 33 applications.</p>
<p>Yes, we really did count.</p>
<p>I actually received grant funding for this, and applied in &amp;#x27;10. I wanted to make sure if we offered at this step that we would still have funding to use for this step. And we do.</p>
<p>If you applied, and found funding, who first? Why did you apply?</p>
<p>Each applicant&amp;#x27;s journey through the various steps is an important part.</p>
<p>If you found funding then you&amp;#x27;d have:</p>
<p>
A note from your advisor telling you the opportunity for grant funding with SBA is open for you.<br>
The opportunity to apply again in either future years.<br>
A meeting with your mentor to talk about what you have found. A call or email to follow up.<br>
</p>
<p>Here&amp;#x27;s what you need to do in the next two weeks:</p>
<p>
EAS yourself to the SBA office.<br>
If the SBA already has funds for you, explain what you do and ask if you can do it next year.<br>
Write your advisor about what you have found.<br>
Once you have all your steps outlined, continue to work on making it happen.<br>
Do not apply with any other letter of intent. The decision not to pursue is not based on your financial situation.<br>
It&amp;#x27;s not that simple.<br>
Don&amp;#x27;t just fill out a form<br>
</p>
<p>People always ask if the next step is filling out an application or paying a fee. There&amp;#x27;s a difference. Making application work is step #1. How you found funding is step #2.</p>
<p>For me, before the interviews, I would have filled out the same application - but would have heard what the students did above, about having the chance to be funded, etc. I would be on the phone with them, say I did great this year, did great next year, etc. Many folks are more eager to talk to potential students than I was, but here&amp;#x27;s the deal - it&amp;#x27;s not that simple to get into a program, so you need the qualifications to make a good impression and end up on the list for whatever it may be.</p>
<p>I&amp;#x27;m a big person, 5&amp;#x27; 11&amp;quot;, 170 lbs.</p>
