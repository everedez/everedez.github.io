<p>Got this product on my car by asking nicely and received it yesterday:</p>
<p>This product has been tested on my car and looks good, can&amp;#x27;t decide how it looks best though. It fits great on your car or vehicle and shows great damage that your car sustained. My car was made from steel (5/8HP) and aluminum (13/16HP) together and it has aluminum headlights and indicators but should be able to withstand this paint. I have had my car for a month and paid $200-600 for this product I think it&amp;#x27;s worth it, especially if your car is older.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Well, this paint is a pretty good match for the car as it protects them and it covers it very well. Very tough coat and very durable for the price.</p>
<p>The more the paint looks like it has straight lines, the better the job it will be done. The coat will last and the paint will keep looking all shiny and new for a long time if not painted longer.</p>
<p>Stuff like this car is going to survive. In today&amp;#x27;s economy, this is something that anyone can get for under a hundred bucks which is a pretty sweet deal. Best price that I&amp;#x27;ve seen for this paint myself.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>The paint has areas that show signs of wear and have flaws now and then. Sometimes the scratches on the panels can be a little too deep. For example, I would take over the windshield or engine bollards or something that fits into where the coat is starting to lift and give you that much more of a darkline or other imperfection that usually happen anyway since cars are exposed outdoors. Or, sometimes they can just be too deep and take on the look of warping from the roughness of the rubbing of a car. That said, they can be painted though or you can buy one of the paint options for a few extra bucks.</p>
<p>Customer service has always been lacking with all the customer complaints I&amp;#x27;ve received (and been sent these as well) because (as stated above) the product is totally and totally worth it and just looks quite good.</p>
<p>Overall, this product is a nice deal and worth the money and certainly good thing that it&amp;#x27;s got such a pretty finish that&amp;#x27;s going to last you for a long time.</p>
