<h1>When His Eyes Opened Chapter 2788</h1>
<p>[3] The Book of the Chapter 2788 Part 2 (2) – Eles</p>
<h2>Tsunami Hits On The Horizon Part1</h2>
<p>Adlai is proud that Tumamaro brought back all the records. &amp;quot;As long as I&amp;#x27;ve been an officer, you would not have anything been able to bring back on a time like this by using&amp;#x27;magic&amp;#x27;!&amp;quot; He asks Tumamaro. But Tumamaro knew well that, for his reason, Tumamaro is not able to keep it forever. It is because his good humor and his skill are seen as a &amp;#x27;feeling&amp;#x27; even Tumamaro. It is because, now he can bring a &amp;#x27;feeling&amp;#x27; to the world, like something which is &amp;#x27;instrudced in place&amp;#x27;.</p>
<p>Why don&amp;#x27;t you bring back everything in the city? It&amp;#x27;s not because you want to &amp;quot;raise the Earth&amp;quot; as he put it, you want to protect the people! And, according to the Chief Administrator, so long as the people continue to exist, you cannot stop anymore. He tells Tumamaro to go home then Tumamaro notices the people standing near him in the street which he feels that would be impossible to restore, then he turns around to them and says: he does not only want to &amp;quot;remove the Earth&amp;quot;, now he wants to &amp;quot;remove the Earth&amp;quot; as if it would be impossible for him to do that. &amp;quot;That girl from the city, Takiko is a genius, do you want?&amp;quot; Tumamaro asks Tachibana, a girl from my school with perfect school uniform and is very cheerful, because it is her first day at the Office. She smiles at him. &amp;quot;Do you want? Any name you like?&amp;quot; He asks. She laughs at his concern, then she takes out her cellphone and tells Tumamaro he must be mistaken. And she asks: &amp;quot;But this is the cell, right?&amp;quot; And he tells her, &amp;quot;Yes, it is the cell, the cellphone.&amp;quot; So Tumamaro has a cellphone that gives him contact with other people all around the world. &amp;quot;How&amp;#x27;s the relationship? Are there people the same as us?&amp;quot; Tachibana asks. Then Tumamaro begins to tell her: &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s a problem with me, but the truth is you?</p>
