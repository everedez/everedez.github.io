<h1>Ahmad Adeyanju</h1>
<p>The controversy is even bigger about his personal position in our Country.</p>
<p>When Abuses against Persons and Spies over Muslim Civil Societies was being defined. This was the biggest political issue in Nigeria. And why do our Muslims join those politics while trying their best in the dark avenues of power they have?.</p>
<p>As you can imagine the President himself, Mr. Goodluck Ebeye Ikange, has denied these allegations in a press statement, dated May 26, 2019, at:</p>
<p>We, in the last few issues of the news conference, were asked to explain the discrepancy between what is reported in the news as factual and the information that is held on record on the Civil Society Community website.</p>
<p>â€¦ We answer this because the Civil Society Community is the public face of the Civil Society Movement, the watchdog of the State, and one which most Nigerians look back on with great pride.</p>
<p>The News on the Web website is public and is freely available. The same, by the way, would apply to the Facebook page of the Movement.</p>
<p>If the Civil Society Movement is the media which all Nigerians now are increasingly relying on, the news on the web is now public and the same applies to the Facebook page of the same.</p>
<h2>Who Are You to Criticise?</h2>
<p>The Civil Society Movement has always been concerned that its members and contributors were not being fully engaged in their work.</p>
<p>The Movement has been concerned about whether or not certain persons among its members were making their contributions in such a way as to avoid the consequences of the Movement and its rules. The criticism was about corruption. Who are you to question?</p>
<p>But not many of you know what is the allegation. They are not saying that you are not doing your job and only going to vote for those who are putting in quality value of life for our people. They are not saying that you are not stopping and also complaining where you do not have the right. They are not saying that you did the wrong thing as suggested during the Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Nigeria and Civil Society, the Ad Hoc Committee.</p>
