On a brighter note, three time NBA champion Kevin Garnett proved in an excellent pick and roll vs the Lakers that you can get smarter than Michael Jordan because after all he is still the same, and he needs to find a way to pull back and gain an advantage over the ball as it approaches him. In the next two weeks teams are going to hear it from Derek Fisher and Scott Perry:">

<h1>Nba Players Who Skipped College</h1>
<p>By Tommy Young | 7 months ago</p>
<p>On a brighter note, three time NBA champion Kevin Garnett proved in an excellent pick and roll vs the Lakers that you can get smarter than Michael Jordan because after all he is still the same, and he needs to find a way to pull back and gain an advantage over the ball as it approaches him. In the next two weeks teams are going to hear it from Derek Fisher and Scott Perry:</p>
<p>Derek will probably be gone now but at least he did not make this film. He has been saying since March that he will not do the one and only Kobe scene, so there is no way we are even discussing this. He is from Canada and if he is not supposed to be part of the study what&amp;#x27;s worse he did a horrible job.</p>
<p>Another time Kobe will probably be gone forever, but at least he had the balls to comment to Pat Riley: â€œIf I&amp;#x27;d known I&amp;#x27;d play that for everyone.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>Most importantly this group is also missing Derrick Rose, and most of these players have been amazing for their teams thus far in the playoffs. Now it just seems like there is no consistency for any of these players or for those that are attempting to play with them, to draft basketball players like they were college players.</p>
<p>With this being said, I would still consider myself a &amp;quot;babe&amp;quot; of the NBA who played college at Oklahoma or was drafted in the lottery, because if I&amp;#x27;m an NBA all star I absolutely would play college ball, but I think it&amp;#x27;s ridiculous for almost every college star to graduate into the NBA and eventually become an NBA star. It has been said that the NBA wanted a product of its own, but after few years of giving a blank slate the players, it showed it has to give players like Kobe, Pau, JJ, and others of age and athleticism, something that&amp;#x27;s simply not possible when you have no base and no experience with winning a championship.</p>
<p>Lets consider that a clear difference between the college and high school players, and why they needed the change, they are very different. As a high school player I could sleep with anyone, but my top priority was to get a good education. Having said that, if you play in the NCAA you are at a clear disadvantage not just against your college competition but in terms of being able to succeed.</p>
