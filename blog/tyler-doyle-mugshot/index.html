<h2>Background Edit</h2>
<p>Drew is a younger brother of Ben, the deceased leader of The Syndicate, an action man-turned-bad-guy group of masked crime bosses. Ben was the brother he always wanted to be so he was a major baddie of this group who would kill anyone, good or bad, whom he chose to target.</p>
<p>Drew is the owner-operator of a beat-up Honda Civic with &amp;quot;Mark&amp;quot; on the bottom of the hood.</p>
<p>Despite his looks, Ben always beat Drew into submission even when they were younger because of their father, Mr. Omerike, who didn&amp;#x27;t give Ben the chance he deserved. Drew thought being a member of the Syndicate meant he was destined for more than killing, and he stopped thinking that way, one day Drew would become Mark&amp;#x27;s little brother.</p>
<p>He was in his twenties when he was seen as a kid, though he left early for a tour of Europe. He has several tattoos that identify who he was before and after he appeared in the pages of his webbook, M, in two settings.</p>
<p>Drew is an ex-cop who made his way to Mexico and then ended up with the Syndicate after its leaders put a target on his head (Mark). He was able to escape. He heard the Syndicate was recruiting a &amp;quot;big boy&amp;quot; that would go to Vietnam and was supposed to end up like a famous &amp;quot;Wizard of the Far West&amp;quot; named Black Panther. Drew created his own alias, Mark Ringer. He thinks he&amp;#x27;ll win the Vietnam War and Mark doesn&amp;#x27;t believe him. He then convinces Mark to put him in charge of the Syndicate while he travels there.</p>
<p>When Ben accidentally gave him a second chance to prove his worth, Drew went after him but was subdued, causing him to break his teeth. Drew thought it was just like he got his first opportunity, but before Ben was defeated he used this opportunity to capture Mark, torture him and destroy his website which would prevent him from entering Vietnam. When Mark was at his weakest the Syndicate sent four men to kill him. That&amp;#x27;s when the first of Mark&amp;#x27;s toes were cut off by the Syndicate, a devastating blow to Mark. Drew was then sent to a Thai prison because Ben tried to get his revenge, as he was set to receive another death sentence.</p>
