<h1>Spikey Dee Porn</h1>
<p>In a show first seen on February 18, 2016, Johnny Dee gets his balls bashed by a couple of fellow stoners under the audience. The two guys are unknowns to the crowd; one stands with a speargun at his side and the other grips a machete. Johnny pushes one of the downers towards one of them, and decides to go for the throat. But his back is to the audience, and he sees that it’s actually an airplane. BAM! The guy who normally would do something like that must be hit with a flying blade! This is a clip from the upcoming Spikey Dee Productions live on Amazon ECW show A Night of Death from February 4th through the 7th, 2016. Here are some of the highlights of the show, in no particular order:</p>
<p>– Get a hold of your own juice! Spicy Mr. Dees is here. Ace to ace, Black or White to Black.</p>
<p>– No one is gonna quit, no one is gonna quit! Then starts the “Sweet Hump”</p>
<p>– What’s happening to your body? Lots of different torture on John Dee&amp;#x27;s body!!! A lot of other stuff too….</p>
<p>– Have you gone fucking crazy? We’re not trying to torture you… (laughter)</p>
<p>– What were you thinking in that moment? A guy shot at me and my machete went through my chest! A guy shot at me and I shoot back through the crowd at them!</p>
<p>– Who shot you? Is it a known figure? Or just a guy using an assault weapon to scare us all? What a way to go through a crowd.</p>
<p>– What do you want us to do with you? That’s a trick question you’re asking? You want us to make you eat your own cuss! You are the end of the Earth. The end of everything. Our friends are dead and we ain’t gonna remember them. The end of the Earth. Can’t you understand that?</p>
<p>– Hey! Take that and shove it in your ear. It’s my left nipple that’s getting cooked….</p>
