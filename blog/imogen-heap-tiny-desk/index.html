<h1>Imogen Heap Tiny Desk</h1>

I am the author of Fido<br>
And I am so excited to make it official. A collection of my designs and my life in collaboration.<br>

<p>And for everyone who left their Numeratics spreadsheet out of this morning’s blog, I apologize--it’s been a crappy week for me, but I will handle it. I think everyone got the message, but the spreadsheet is a good place for everyone to check on the progress of their little friend, Fido.</p>
<p>I went to high school with this brilliant designer named Noah Gelobter (of AmericanApparel.com fame) and got to say a few words, then we used to watch SuperEgo with him when we were students together. I think that was the first time you saw him in the flesh. Later, he got his own collection and our lives became chock full of fun.</p>
<p>Anyway, Noah wanted an update on the nubby little guy called Fido, and my dear friend Lindsay (aka Fido Noakes!) and I got to thinking. Who better than ourselves to make the little guy look bad? Oh, it’s just not Noah’s style though. It used to be short shorts and a Capri tee, but now it’s short shorts and flannel pajamas. He wants his own little space where he can play and not worry about how he looks. That can’t be too much to ask. So I contacted LAB Toys and we went to see the office. Let’s just say I’m not thrilled about the changes. I tried my best to explain it all to them and they have done a lot of work on this. We do still have some models but this little guy is going to have to get his own desk, and a place to sit and eat and watch his favorite cartoons. And maybe I can be his guest at dinner someday.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you all will be excited.</p>
