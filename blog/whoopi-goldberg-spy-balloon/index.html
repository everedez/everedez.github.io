<h1>Whoopi Goldberg Spy Balloon</h1>
<p>Tweet via Instagram A gorgeous photo of the finished project with the words “Chasing Spy Balloon is a simple one-page script that&amp;#x27;s meant to be extended indefinitely with additional scenes and locations that I hope you&amp;#x27;ll create to be found on your own in your town or country. ”</p>
<p>It&amp;#x27;s the perfect complement to a cocktail book filled with delicious quotes and stories in case you get into a slump like we do.</p>
<p>
The pages are easy to make and the balloons pop out and tie on to give you a banner for your own events.<br>
Including Easter as well as Halloween this year!<br>
Also a great way to share good cheer. :-)<br>

<p>My favorite example of how this page can be used for various purposes including sending balloons out into the community is in this post entitled &amp;quot;Worded Joke&amp;quot; from Vine Street Graphics:</p>
<p>&amp;quot;We often find ourselves stuck in a rut or daydreaming about the possibilities that would be possible if we could just do the impossible and actually hit &amp;quot;send,&amp;quot; that one thing that will make us laugh because we know that no one is listening.</p>
