<p>Why is the Rivendell name so prominent? What is its significance?</p>
<p>The Rivendell name appears in the core fiction books as a black or redish color with a white line running through the center, commonly known as ’the fence.’ In the core fiction, the Rivendell and its artifacts remain unknown by many. Only within the Nexus does it feature as some sort of dark lord, one of the closest to the Nameless One. The Rivendell are something like spiders, and their scuttling activities were described in the first two books. There was supposed to be a series of events involving the Rivendell, one involving the first dark lord in the universe, but most likely, the following events are not connected.</p>
<p>There was supposed to be an attack on Rivendell by the Nameless One, but it did not happen. The following is an excerpt from my tale &amp;quot;The Snake Men,&amp;quot; which was inspired by historical events:</p>
<p>The small town of Añasco sits in Añasco Canyon, just north of the western border of Mendocino County, just south of the scenic Butte. It’d been here all of its history. This small white building was not meant to be a sign of goodbyes but to be the staging area for the large crowd of travelers heading to the cliffs. This small white building was once the valley’s most popular tourist trap. There was so much not just for locals but for tourists, so many tourists that the town no longer had a name.</p>
