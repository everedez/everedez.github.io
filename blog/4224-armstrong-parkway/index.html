<p>An Item to Consider? - What are the pros and cons of buying this item from a reputed third party and what size do I need?</p>
<p>Since 1999, with the intention of protecting our country. The product you see was used to manufacture a full scale model of a tank. We are a family business and we understand that for this special line of quality items, it is a trade-off. While we believe in protecting our customer, by working hard on a limited budget and short time frame, we have not been able to be as successful as other vendors in the industry. We are always looking for more ways to maintain our integrity. This means designing items that we can only sustain selling. Thus, using a third party product from them can cause you to lose your product if it is an example of abuse or harm that we were not able to resolve with that vendor.</p>
<p>It is very important that you educate yourself and read through the rules and our web site for any items that you intend to purchase. Once we have it designed, we can supply to you with a pricing list, specific instructions and get a rate for any item that you purchase from us. The customer service that we provide is one hundred percent and we take care of the customer&amp;#x27;s needs as if its our own, which is why we choose to work with them.</p>
<h2>The Product Lifecycle</h2>
<p>For nearly two years, I&amp;#x27;ve watched and supported the steady manufacturing progression of the product called The Tank from Bremen, Germany. It has been designed for the past fifteen years and was available for purchase as a full scale model.</p>
