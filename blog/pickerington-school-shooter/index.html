<h1>Pickerington School Shooter</h1>
<p>
Victims&amp;#x27; testimony on hand, and the count of the district courts<br>
of Maine.<br>
The defendant Andrew Patrick Mahomes<br>
United States District Court<br>
District of Maine<br>
Portland, Me<br>
against<br>
</p>
<p>State of Maine:</p>
<p>
Richard J. Landau<br>
Federal Defender Office<br>
and Barras<br>
Legal Aid of Maine<br>
at Portland<br>
Count three<br>
unnamed defendant, on March 17, 1996 at approximately 3 A.M., drove a car, which<br>
had been identified as similar to the one that went into the school, to the<br>
International Union of Operating Engineers District Office in Portland. On<br>
March 18, 1996 Mr. Mahomes (hereinafter &amp;quot;Mahomes&amp;quot;), then 32 years old, is<br>
charged with being an armed career criminal in violation of 18 U.S.C.<br>
</p>
<h2>§ 924(e) (1994), 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9)(B) (1994), and 18 U.S.C. § 922 (A)(bb)</h2>
<p>
(1994).<br>
As to the statute under which Mahomes is charged, there are two essential facts<br>
which Mahomes is alleged to have committed: (1) he &amp;quot;possessed a firearm or<br>
destructive device as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3) (1994)&amp;quot;; and (2) the<br>
statute under which he is charged makes that felony a crime of violence<br>
under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A) (1994).<br>
As to his second factual allegation, however, Mahomes takes issue<br>
with the legal position the district court has taken regarding the first allegation.<br>
Nowhere does the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. § § 921(a)(3) appear anywhere<br>
in the statute authorizing 18 U.S.C.<br>
