This was one of the more challenging power surges we experienced with our system.

<p>It was less than 6 hours after this incident, while checking the power back on, that the system started up, and the image below is one of the last screens on the image that I recorded. As you can tell, the system is now able to properly send and receive TV signals.</p>
<p>This is a heavily modified version of this screenshot. It was taken while checking power of the system. In this example, the DVRs have lost power to all of them, but unlike this one, this time around, it was a 30-degree loss of power, which is still only 1% or so of the power they had before. If you wanted to add that to the system, that might go another 30 degrees or so from zero again.That&amp;#x27;s right, just like the previous DVR overcharge was an over-powering of the DVRs, this one was a loss of power to the system as a whole, but only one DVR was going to have a bad time.I know this sounds like too much to ask, so please stay tuned to let us know if you have similar experiences.Power is a huge issue for any company, but so was the other matter. When can we expect a complete recovery as we re-position our equipment?It was less than 6 hours after this incident, while checking the power back on, that the system started up, and the image below is one of the last screens on the image that I recorded.</p>
