<p>The Weber County records are the basis for many Utah historical research projects and, in many instances, are the only independent source for information about an area. The Historical Division of the Weber County Clerk&amp;#x27;s office records comprise both county records and private records. They are collected, edited, and researched by volunteers and may be accessed on request. Utah State Archivists maintain a large collection of historical artifacts, documents, photographs, memorabilia, and other items that are examples of public and private documents and materials. A full, unabridged text of the historical records is available through the historic database at WeberCountyHistory.org. The archive is also available as an Internet archive.</p>
<h2>The Dorn Children House Museum, Weber</h2>
<p>There is a full-scale recreation area with the Dorn Children House Museum on display in the main building of the Dorn Family House in the Main Street West Historic District of Weber County, Utah.
