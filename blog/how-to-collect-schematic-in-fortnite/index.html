<h1>How To Collect Schematic In Fortnite</h1>
<p>We don&amp;#x27;t usually play other games during tournaments, and honestly we often forget about the game we have signed up for to focus on something else. For example, If you&amp;#x27;re making screenshots, I usually forget about myself and our keyboards.</p>
<p>But that&amp;#x27;s not always the case. During Fortnite&amp;#x27;s Fortnite Battle Royale season break, we got to play a few of our favorite games, and we completely forgot about those we&amp;#x27;d once brought along with us.</p>
<p>With our players tired and our brains now free from any anxiety and stress from the competition, we decided to reminisce about what we played back when we were playing the game on my bed, my kitchen table, or even on the beach. I think it&amp;#x27;s amazing, and super helpful to remember and recollect when we reminisce.</p>
<p>So here are some of the games that were played for this Fortnite tournament with me and my friends:</p>
<h2>1. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2>
<p>This game was played on our kitchen table of my house in between some homework. We used my laptop as the starting PC, so we were able to comfortably use my keyboard as well; which, once again, was nice.</p>
<p>You&amp;#x27;re a hedge-fund manager, you don&amp;#x27;t have time for homework.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but games are good. They’re relaxing. And playing games during tournaments is an excellent way to stay energized in that kind of heat. I can imagine how fun I’d have with another gaming group if one of them was my taste-maker.</p>
<p>We played on the couch again after a night or two, because we didn&amp;#x27;t mind being on my kitchen couch, which was a good choice in terms of comfort.</p>
<p>My first player was probably the best player of all, and actually by a long shot, there wasn&amp;#x27;t a player that rivaled his skill level:</p>
<p>I won a bunch of hearts and chests, too, and more than a couple hearts, but it was more competitive than the majority of the gameplay. Like I said, this is a relaxing way to spend some time online. Plus, there&amp;#x27;s the community aspect, which I think is really important to make the most out of.</p>
