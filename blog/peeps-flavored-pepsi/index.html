<h1>Peeps Flavored Pepsi</h1>
<p>Pepsi began in 1886 as Pepsi&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Sweet To the Heart&amp;quot; beverage. Over the years they developed a wide range of flavors such as peach &amp;amp; cinnamon which has become very popular over the years (so, to get a taste please visit our online store HERE)!</p>
<p>As the corporation seems to have made their mind up it&amp;#x27;s time to see what the final product looks like. The picture above features red version of PEPsi&amp;#x27;s bottle with a bottle cap attached. I had to ask myself, do I prefer the red PEPsi (with red on PEPsi) or the blue Pepsi? Unfortunately the online store does not indicate an answer :) On to the rest of the image I&amp;#x27;ve left it as an option for you.</p>
<p>Now, read the rest of the article to know the answer :)</p>

<p>Just like the real world, your eye may quickly deceive you.For your eye sees only what it was trained to look for-that is how your mind is looking at things,your brain expects you to see what your brain trained you to. If you will consider the diagram that follows closely you will notice that your brain will not necessarily look for the brightest-only for those things that will contribute to your goal of &amp;quot;success&amp;quot;. That is not meant as a judgment on you-but to provide you a small tool that will help you see things as they are really-for you.</p>
<h2>&amp;quot;Thou Knowest How To Make Things Right&amp;quot;</h2>
<p>The hardest part of the job of being human is to see what does not exist but to expect people to believe something that stands there staring you in the face. For instance, if someone like Michael Jordan walks into your living room and says &amp;quot;My God, you are beautiful&amp;quot; you might have a feeling of being insulted and would suspect he will appear again as an overweight, potbellied man.</p>
