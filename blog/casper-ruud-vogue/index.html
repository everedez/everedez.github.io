Childhood<br>
</p>
<p>In 1943, Charlotte Manet is born to a Dutch father and French mother in the Porte Maillot refugee camp in Algeria. She is one of the greatest inventors known to the world, first author of the Red Box Book, which revolutionizes the world of international finance, later discovered the book is not a hoax (1) and that James Bond is her son (2).</p>
<p>After her father receives her from the World War II refugee camp, she goes through much of the camp and is sent to her grandparents and aunt&amp;#x27;s house, where her mother has already been killed, for a few months following her birth. She also visits her father for a few months, and ends up staying with him in Germany for the rest of the war, and therefore is unable to work (3). After her father returns to Europe, she is sent to England to finish high school, where she quits school to take care of her family (4–6).</p>
<p>She then moves in with her aunt in London in 1944, and meets his English wife, Charlotte Arnall, and the rest of their married friends at a dance in the flat of her Aunt Mary while waiting for her brothers, Cecil and Alexander Arnall, to return home. This brings her into contact with them, and they propose to her.</p>
<p>On the day of their wedding, Charlotte and Cecil go to the dance, and they are not expected to come back, but a young friend of hers, Sue Curtis, sends her photos of Charlotte and Cecil. Cecil asks Charlotte to go with him to the dance, and they both end up falling for each other (7–10).</p>
<p>In 1945, Charlotte and Cecil go back to London. Charlotte is pregnant with her first child, and has to go to labour before Charlotte&amp;#x27;s mother finds out about it. However, soon after she gives birth to her son, she realizes this is the father, but she doesn&amp;#x27;t know that her father and mother are dead, and she feels so guilty that she does not communicate with her brother and aunt through some intermediary, not knowing she had done something wrong before. She also feels hurt that her aunt has shared this secret with her and that the marriage is over (11).</p>
