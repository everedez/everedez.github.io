<h1>Hagia Sophia Earthquake</h1>
<p>4,016 years ago: On Christmas Eve, in 9 CE, a huge earthquake shook Constantinople (which houses Constantinople, the spiritual capital of Constantinople); it was followed by a tsunami that was expected to wipe off everything in the area.</p>
<p>An inventory of the damages was conducted shortly after 5 April 2017 (see below). After an initial recovery in Constantinople, the waves of destruction intensified during the following months, including the third Great Turkish Cyclone of 2016.</p>
<p>The catastrophic earthquakes and surges are both attributed with causing subsequent tsunamis in the area.</p>
<p>However, the word tavtı, which means &amp;quot;typhoon&amp;quot;, originated from the Anatolia region rather than the rest of the world. In modern usage it has become the origin of the word typhoon, which denotes an angry sudden wind storm.</p>
<h2>Ancestry (Phoenician)</h2>
<p>It is currently possible to trace the ancestry of the region (see 2 - 9.02), which has never been established with certainty. The current known migration history can be found in the texts Ptolemy’s Geography, which shows that the Syrians migrated from this region, but his account also includes those from Egypt, Ptolemaic Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria, and others. The DNA studies corroborate the two main sources that suggest a Syrian branch that probably reached Anatolia.</p>
<p>Syrians from the Caucasus area have, among others, been tracked, who were probably settled in the Hittite homeland in the Fertile Crescent, and indeed between 1030-1025 Anatolia was founded, where first of all Hittite colonies were founded. Yet it is possible to trace the southern branch into this region, which can be followed through the centuries, as both the Byzantines and many Syriacs have been said to be very proud of being Armenians.</p>
<h2>Ancient Anatolia</h2>
<p>The great Empire of the Huns, on which Turkey itself was founded, extended from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea; it ruled Central Anatolia for almost a millennium, and so its presence in Anatolia probably dates back to the Stone Age. Nevertheless, archeology has proven hard to confirm the existence of Anatolian Greeks, as most living individuals there were either pagan or Hellenophile, and that all the inhabitants were probably either a different ethnicity or simply never were Greek.</p>
