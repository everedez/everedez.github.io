<p>Bio: Eddie is from a family of artists in New York City. Growing up poor, he dropped out of a paint course at age 13 to find only scraps to hang on his walls. His work started to influence his older brother as his parents both fell in love with the pop artist Syd, also a New York native. Eddie continued to impress his family when his brother gave him a new guitar on one of his first gigs around the age of 25. From there he met his first partner in music at the age of 30. And went on to forge some of the most significant music in American pop history. His best selling album was an EP called Come Around Often, which became very popular in the 1980s. He worked with then popular singers on such songs as &amp;quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Fannie Is A Freak&amp;quot; among many others, and has also done many television commercials to that effect. With him now is Dustin Funko, a Canadian native, artist, graphic designer, and fellow musician. With The Un-Noises, his first major production album for the now long-failing company, they now have a history in original and amazing remixes of existing stuff all over the world. For 15 years Dustin created music that inspired people in any walk of life when he spoke about it. He has written and performed songs that will still turn a few heads this 90s era. He brings a masterful degree of all sorts of music to his songs from mood to melody. And is very true to himself with his stories as he likes to tell them.</p>
