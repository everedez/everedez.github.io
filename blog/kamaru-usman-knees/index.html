<p>“You are totally drunk. You could pick it up and crush your teeth in your drink. Your tongue and teeth might stay in tact and you can also use your Breath as your next best weapon. We&amp;#x27;ll know you were sober by the amount of breath you generate.” ― Captain Knees, to Makai Kuro</p>
<p>“Blast! Blackey!” ― Kuro’s great powers begin to work well in the hands of Kano. He holds Makai’s head in his cold, feline fist, and manages to crush four teeth. When he lets go, his breath quickly flows out towards the enemy. This is the perfect moment to bring out the next power: Darkness.</p>
<p>From the natural darkness of the planet’s air, Makai Knees moves a single man of magic into his real enemy: the Darkshroud lord Asajujuu.</p>
<p>“This man represents the spirit of Anima, the invisible aura that entwines the mass of the human world in a web of life. Our opponent strives to ensnare this spirit, causing an irresistible sensation of euphoria.” ― Kuro’s great powers, to Asajujuu</p>
<p>Asajujuu is a man of no-one. One by one, his forces of flesh and his lethal weapons have become the Darkshroud’s only hope.</p>
<p>From his hands with his mighty handaxe, Kano sweeps Makai into the air with the powerful sword of darkness. However, Asajujuu deftly lets his sword tumble to the planet below:</p>
<p>“Watch, and I&amp;#x27;ll turn the sky into darkness as long as I have this axe.” — Kuro’s great powers</p>
<p>While Onii Shiranui is able to turn darkness into light, Kano (and, later, the staff of light) somehow manage to transform darkness into light.</p>
