<p>On June 17th, 1983, Renato Gamba&amp;#x27;s career was rapidly ascending in Argentina. Gamba was the world champion from 1980-1987 and in 1987 he won the world championship. Now Gamba represented Argentina in the Olympics from 1984-1988. Gamba won the gold medal in the men&amp;#x27;s boxing with a record of 11 wins and 1 loss in the competition. Gamba&amp;#x27;s career was also blazing in 1985-1989 as he won 2 Olympic titles, in the men&amp;#x27;s lightweight and middleweight respectively. He moved on to be a professional boxer in 1989 becoming World middleweight champion to face Lennox Lewis.</p>
<p>After winning his first match on September 13th of 1989 Gamba was in the UFC having changed his name to Bob Arum. Gamba&amp;#x27;s career was also on a dazzling spike, in 1990 he collected 2 wins and 2 losses. In 1991 he collected his first win, which led to his first 5 wins in the year. In 1992 he became world champion by winning 9 of his first 12 fights before he was defeated by Ric Flair. In 1993 Gamba finished top 10 in the WBC middleweight division in Zaire. Just two months later, on April 4th, 1993 he met and beat Tim Sylvia in his first encounter at the main stadium in his native country.</p>
<p>After his spectacular second victory over Sylvia, Gamba went on to secure another victory, over Tom Greiss, to top 5 in the under the age of 38 years. In 1994 Gamba had his first televised match on November 11th in Buenos Aires. This match was very popular, generating media coverage leading to a battle for the vacant world championship. In his first fight Gamba won against Tito Trinidad and in the second fight Gamba won against Erislandy Lara. In 1996 Gamba scored his biggest win against Michael Bisping. In the same year, Gamba easily stopped the King of the Middleweight division once and then dethroned him twice as well as beating Gennady Golota. In his next fight, he defended his world championship title against Renan Barao. Now Gamba was on his quest for a second world championship.</p>
