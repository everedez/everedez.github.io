<h1>Michelle Robinson Sid Vicious</h1>
<h3>AUTHORS:</h3>
<p>If you are a producer, artist, musician, label employee, or anyone who has to hire people, you can learn a thing or two from Amanda Stangelov, founder of the Fullerton, CA based woman&amp;#x27;s apparel company, Fullerton Apparel. Like many people, Amanda&amp;#x27;s ideas of what to wear came from her father, Pete, who grew up in a family with a penchant for the outrageous and unpredictable. As a child he used to always dress up in anything he could find when he walked to school - from gym shorts and T-shirts, to back-less, stretch shorts - anything he could get his hands on, that he could take with him. These short, tight jeans often left little to the imagination - the ones you can see on Johnny Depp had to be either on backless form, or covered in latex. He was the proud creator of the Fullerton brand, an umbrella name for all the clothing and accessories you can get your hands on. Over a twenty year career, fullerton has provided nearly every type of garment for both men and women from outer layers of rubber to high-end upmarket apparel to anything in between. And each creation goes all the way down to the sock. Whatever you choose to buy from Fullerton, their work will turn heads along the way.</p>
<p>As the wife of a producer who manages Vondel, Jonathan Skinner, who worked with &amp;quot;Sid&amp;quot; Vicious and subsequently his legal team from the late 1980s until his arrest in 2005, Amanda has spent the past few months working with Vondel and their attorneys to try and make sure the Fullerton Apparel name survives after Sid&amp;#x27;s passing.</p>
<p>Over the past few months Vondel has traveled to Colorado to work with three witnesses and one potential star witness to try and reveal some of Sid&amp;#x27;s true character behind the name &amp;quot;Vicious.&amp;quot; We will dive into the details of the series of meetings that led up to the arrest of Sid Vicious and how he survived. And most recently, Vondel and Skinner visited the Tobi vidz, or the current Vod with a view from New York where the police waited.</p>
