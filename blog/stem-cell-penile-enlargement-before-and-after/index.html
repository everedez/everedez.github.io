Stem Cell Penile Enlargement | Care Planning<br>
Results, Advantages, Complications, and Options<br>
</p>
<p>Stem cell penile enlargement is a treatment option for a subset of patients who are unable to effectively achieve adequate penile enlargements. The aim of the treatment is to increase the size of the penile tissue.</p>
<p>There is a greater proportion of men who develop ED among HIV and other virus-infected men. This is because the immune system generally attacks the penis when it comes into contact with the patient&amp;#x27;s immune system. For patients who are infected with HIV, the treatment will treat the immune response within the infected patients tissue. Treatment with progesterone is usually effective in treating HIV-associated ED. Because progesterone reduces numbers of immune activated white blood cells, there is less inflammatory response to the penis, and HIV patients no longer experience erectile dysfunction. A review of the literature has shown that treatment with progesterone supplements not only improves the quality of erection but also improves the size of penile tissue.</p>
<h2>Patient Instructions</h2>
<p>Patients undergoing stem cell penile enlargement (also known as inflatable penile implant, inflatable penile enhancement implants or EPIs) must:</p>
<p>Take no more than the suggested dose.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to use hormone therapy in the treatment for the penile enlargement. It is generally best to use the dose suggested in the patient&amp;#x27;s clinical counseling. It is always best to discuss the risks and complications of hormone therapy and hormone supplementation with the patient. Patients on hormone therapy and supplementation may or may not be concerned about their vaginal dryness. Some patients experience vaginal dryness with estrogen and/or progesterone supplementation, but the risk of vaginal dryness is very low.</p>
<p>Before surgery, patients should be screened for bone loss. Bone mineral density (BMD) should be measured prior to surgery. Post-operatively, all patients should maintain dietary adherence. Patients should have blood levels of estrogen and progesterone monitored throughout postoperative therapy.</p>
<p>Are there complications from stem cell penile enlargement? You will be required to discontinue the use of estrogen therapy if symptoms of vaginal dryness occur. This may limit the use of progesterone treatments and as a result may limit the options available.</p>
